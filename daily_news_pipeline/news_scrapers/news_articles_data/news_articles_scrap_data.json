    "title": "President Trump & Pam Biondi Fires Diddy & Epstein Prosecutor In MAGA Sacrifice",
    "description": "Justice Department federal prosecutor Maurene Comey lost her job Wednesday (July 16) week in New York’s Southern District after leading sex trafficking cases against bothSean “Diddy” Combsand Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nComey, the daughter of Donald Trump’s sworn enemy and former FBI Director James Comey, was reportedly dismissed by Attorney General Pam Bondi, who issued the removal with support fromDonald Trump.\nA letter reportedly mentioned “Article II of the Constitution,” pointing to the president’s executive powers, although no further explanation has been given.\nThe Department of Justice hasn’t commented. Neither the U.S. Attorney’s Office nor the White House, according to sources.\nComey was a lead in prosecutingDiddy, who is awaiting sentencing on October 3 for federal sex-trafficking charges. She also led previous efforts in the Epstein investigation and was part ofthe team that contributed to Ghislaine Maxwell‘s conviction.\nThough the official reasoning hasn’t surfaced,the decision has been seen by President Trump’s critics as more political than procedural, as MAGA loyalists grow increasingly agitated over Biondi’s handling of Epstein-related documents.\nComey’s removal adds another wrinkle to a broader internal conflict within MAGA circles over the lack of transparency surrounding the Epstein case.\nMAGA extremists have demanded access to sealed Epstein documents, growing increasingly suspicious over the Justice Department’s repeated claim that “there is no client list” and no evidence of blackmail.\nCritics in conservative media are accusing the administration of hiding explosive information.\nMAGA infighting has erupted, with some demanding resignations within the Justice Department over what’s being portrayed by hardliners as a government-wide cover-up.\nDonald Trump himself has dismissed the outrage. He recently lashed out at the concerns, labeling critics “weaklings” and accusing his base of falling for a “b####### hoax.”\nWe having been calling for Maurene Comey’s firing for months. Why now, it’s so obvious Pam Bondi is throwing us a bone because of the Epstein disaster.\nFiring Maurene Comey means she has to hand over all documents pertaining to Jeffrey Epstein .She has no control over this case anymore .It’s in the hands of the DOJ and Pam Bondi .This could get interesting\nNothing says “totally not on the Epstein list” like firing the prosecutor on the Epstein casehttps://t.co/luBMWDS0aU\nAnd then we had James Comey's daughter Maurene Comey burry it all at The US Justice Department!!!🤣🤣🤣🤣\nBased on the handling of the Epstein case the deep state must be happy with Maurene Comey's contribution. Now they have no more need for her and her firing creates a rare positive optic.\nP###-GATE 2025! As MTG and Mike Johnson said, release all the Epstein files! Why was Maurene Comey, federal prosecutor in Epstein case, fired from US attorney’s office today? Who is being protected? True Republicans will not be gaslighted!\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "description": "Barack Obamaopened up about fatherhood and personal shortcomings during a revealing conversation onMichelle Obama‘s podcast, admitting he’s thankful he didn’t have to raise a son because he believes it would have been “more difficult.”\n\nThe former president, now 63, joined his wife on her show,Michelle Obama: The Light Podcast, where he reflected on parenting their daughters,Malia, 27, andSasha, 24, and why he’s relieved they never had a son.\n“I think we did a pretty good job of raising our girls, but I’ve said often that I think I would have had more difficulty raising a son,”Barack Obamasaid. Michelle, 61, didn’t hesitate to back him up, replying, “I agree.”\nObama explained that his concern wasn’t about discipline or expectations—it was empathy. “I think I might’ve been more judgmental, harder,” he admitted.\nHe also pointed to his own upbringing, which lacked a consistent male role model.\n“I would’ve tried to—I’d like to think I would have been more self-aware enough to combat that,” he said. “But I just think father-son relationships, for me, particularly if I don’t have a dad around to show it to me, might’ve been more difficult.”\nObama’s father, Barack Obama Sr., was largely absent from his life.\nIn a 2021 Instagram post, the former president wrote, “I didn’t really know my father—he left my mother and me when I was two years old, and only traveled from Kenya to visit us once, when I was ten. That trip was the first and last I saw of him; after that, I heard from him only through the occasional letter.”\nThe episode adds another layer to Obama’s long-standing reflections on fatherhood, identity and the emotional gaps left by his father’s absence. The podcast was released in 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "description": "A woman named Talia Jones was taken into custody Tuesday (July 15) in Minneapolis by U.S. Marshals after being charged in connection with theJanuary shooting death of Patrick Houston Jr.,the son of Memphis rap veteran and brother of Juicy J, Project Pat.\n\nJones, who had been wanted for facilitation of first-degree murder, allegedly resisted arrest when authorities located her. “She did not go quietly,” the U.S. Marshals Service said in a statement. Officials said she physically fought back and tried to avoid being detained.\nThe Memphis Police Department issued a warrant for Jones’ arrest on June 27, nearly six months after Houston Jr. was gunned down in broad daylight at the intersection of Ketchum Road and Long Street near Charjean Park in the Imogene Heights neighborhood. Officers arrived at the scene around 1:15 p.m. on January 10 and found Houston Jr. dead from a gunshot wound, according to a post on Twitter (X) from the department.\nNo further details about the motive or circumstances surrounding the shooting have been released.\nHouston Jr.’s obituary confirmed he was 22 years old. A memorial service was held January 25 at M.J. Edwards Funeral Home in Memphis, with burial following at Memphis Memory Gardens.\nProject Pat, born Patrick Earl Houston, is known for his work with Three 6 Mafia and his solo career, which took off after his 1999 debut album,Ghetty Green. He gained national attention with the 2000 hit “Sippin’ On Some Syrup” and has since collaborated with artists like Drake, Rick Ross and Denzel Curry.\nFollowing his son’s death, Project Pat posted on Instagram, “Boy i thank God for another day. @breakinbaggs @gofoundation9 #letsgo.” DJ Paul, a founding member of Three 6 Mafia, responded with a string of prayer emojis.\nProject Pat now focuses much of his time on prison ministry and runs the Go Foundation, a nonprofit aimed at outreach and rehabilitation for incarcerated individuals.\nJones remains in custody following her arrest in Minnesota.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "description": "Donald Trumpis backing a special investigator to look into the MAGA mess caused by his former buddy and late creep, Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nIn an upcoming interview with journalist John Solomon on Steve Bannon’sWar Room, President Trump reportedly backed the idea to lay to rest his MAGA base’s insatiable obsession with Epstein.\n“Let’s just do it. Let’s get the trust of the American people, let’s get accountability and then let’s focus on the things that matter,” Donald Trump said during the interview.\nEarlier today (July 16), President Trump flipped out over the Epstein drama blowing up inside his own MAGA base, torching “past supporters” and calling the whole thing “b#######.”\nThe president lashed out online after the DOJ and FBI dropped a memo saying there’s no Epstein “client list” and zero proof of blackmail, which basically nuked years of conspiracy theories pushed by far-right influencers and MAGA diehards.\nTrump dragged Democrats and people who still believe the Epstein rumors.\n“Their new SCAM is what we will forever call the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax, and my PAST supporters have bought into this ‘b#######,’ hook, line, and sinker,” Trump wrote in a long rant.\nHe also made it clear he is not a supporter of members of his MAGA base who are adamant that the Trump administration is hiding information.\n“Let these weaklings continue forward and do the Democrats work,” he added, accusing them of falling for lies from the “Lunatic Left.”\nThis meltdown comes after U.S. Attorney GeneralPam Bondiexcited the MAGA base by saying she had an Epstein “client list” sitting on her desk.\nHowever, the Trump administration abruptly closed the case, claiming there was no new information and nothing more to release.\nToo late, though, because the damage was done, especially afterWiredclaimed the FBI’s video of Epstein committing suicide in his prison cell had three minutes cut out of it.\nNow MAGA is at war with itself.\nSome top voices likeDan Bongino have reportedly threatened to quit or demanded Bondi be fired, accusing the Trump circle of being shady and hiding facts.\nOthers say the whole thing’s a media trap and are backing Trump’s play to shut it all down.\nAt the center of it, Trump’s trying to spin the chaos as a win, bragging, “I have had more success in 6 months than perhaps any President in our Country’s history,” while telling people to stop talking about Epstein altogether.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "title": "EXCLUSIVE: Damon Dash Ordered To Court By Judge To Explain Himself Or Face Arrest – Here’s How He Can Get Out Of It",
    "description": "Damon Dashhas been summoned to federal court in Manhattan after failing to turn over key ownership documents tied to a $4 million judgment.\n\nThe judge has grown impatient and warned Dash that he could be arrested if he doesn’t comply by the end of the month.\nU.S. Magistrate Judge Robert W. Lehrburger issued the order after Dash and his company,Poppington LLC, missed a July 10 deadline to submit certificates proving their ownership in several businesses and copyrights.\nThe paperwork was required so the U.S. Marshal could sell the assets at a public auction to help satisfy the judgment. As of July 14, the court confirmed that Dash and Poppington had not complied with the order.\nLehrburger noted this was part of a “pattern of non-compliance and delay” and scheduled a hearing for July 31 at 10 A.M., where Dash must personally explain why he should not face sanctions.\nIf Dash fails to appear, the court may issue a warrant for his arrest and impose financial penalties. However, he can avoid the hearing altogether by submitting the required documents by July 30.\nThe legal battle stems from a years-long dispute with filmmaker Josh Webber over the 2019 film“Dear Frank.”\nDash was removed from the project but later claimed ownership, prompting Webber and Muddy Water Pictures to sue for defamation and copyright infringement.\nIn 2022, a judge ordered Dash to pay $805,000 for failing to comply with court deadlines and refusing to participate in mediation.\nThe situation escalated after Dash made defamatory remarks about Webber on theEarn Your Leisurepodcast. This resulted in a $4 million default judgment in 2025.\nTo recover the damages, the court approved the sale of Dash’s interests in several companies, including Dash Films Inc., Bluroc LLC, Blakroc LLC, Lebanon Improvements LLC, Ocean East Improvements LLC and 1996 Songs LLC. Poppington LLC was also ordered to hand over copyright certificates for multiple films.\nWebber’s legal team confirmed Dash’s attorneys had not delivered the documents.\nEarlier this week,they sent a letter to the court, requesting an arrest warrant and asking that the disputed assets be transferred to the U.S. Marshal for auction.\nDash previously sold his one-third share of Roc-A-Fella Records for a little over $1 million in December 2024, but the proceeds didn’t cover the full judgment due to outstanding obligations to the state of New York, which purchased the asset.\nThe court is now trying to enforce the remaining balance through asset liquidation.\nThe auction will be conducted by the U.S. Marshal, with any leftover funds returned to Dash after the judgment is satisfied.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

They never spoke again. Feature didn’t happen, but he says he’s lost after that as well.”\nThe situation escalated when Minaj posted a photo of Punch with a caption that read: “Me after I suck some good zik. Guarantee you wouldn’t fight a man. We have every tweet of your incessant bullying, lying, & more. Your name was added to that s### list s##### drawers. Same thing that make you laugh make you…s###.”\nSZA appeared to respond indirectly by posting, “Mercury retrograde .. don’t take the bait lol silly goose.” Minaj fired back with a pointed message: “Go draw your freckles back on b##### #JusticeForDemoree #DepositionPerez Liar liar pants on fire. Sounding like a fkng dead dog.”\nSZA didn’t hold back either, writing, “I don’t give a f### bout none of that weird s### you popping.” She later added, “I get bullied by millions online every day then step my ass out onna packed stadium tour where ppl show me REAL love . IN REAL LIFE . My parents are healthy and I’m the most successful I ever been .

One user tweeted at SZA, “Baby, you inserted your self in some s### that didn’t involve you. You ARE NOT THE VICTIM.”\nSZA fired back, “I wasn’t even talking about or to anyone I had just got off stage talkin bout retrograde. N##### @‘d ME.

Riders lost their balance and tumbled, piling onto one another in a heap of sequins, boots and panic.\nNine people were hurt in the melee. One person suffered a broken ankle, seven others were treated at hospitals for scrapes and bruises, and one declined medical attention.\nFootage from the scene showed several concertgoers—many still dressed in Cowboy Carter-inspired outfits—being wheeled away on stretchers and in wheelchairs.\nThe stampede capped off a turbulent week forBeyoncéin Atlanta. Just days earlier, on Tuesday (July 8), her team suffered a major security breach when thieves broke into a rental vehicle andstoleunreleased music and confidential tour materials.\nAmong the items taken were laptops, designer clothing, Apple AirPods Max headphones and, most critically, five thumb drives and hard drives containing unreleased Beyoncé tracks, show footage and both past and future set lists.\nInvestigators tracked the stolen electronics using built-in location services and reviewed surveillance footage from the garage.\nThey recovered partial fingerprints and identified a possible suspect vehicle—a red 2025 Hyundai Elantra. By Tuesday (July 15), an arrest warrant had been issued, though no arrest had been made and the stolen materials remained missing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "description": "Shaquille O’Nealdid not mince words when he warned Robert Griffin III to stop targetingAngel Reese, threatening to “punch you in your f###### face” if the former NFL quarterback posted about her again.\n\nThe heated exchange stems from RG3’s repeated commentary about Reese, including a July 10 post on X that featured a racist, doctored image of her NBA 2K26 video game cover.\nWhile RG3 claimed he was calling out racism, critics said the post only amplified the harm and dragged Reese into unnecessary controversy.\nO’Neal, a longtime supporter and mentor to Reese through their LSU connection, made his stance clear on Bailey Jackson’s “Off The Record” podcast Tuesday (July 15),\n“RGIII, tweet another monkey post about my girl Angel Reese, and I’mma punch you in your f###### face. OK? It’s enough. Like, I don’t usually do stuff like this but stop it, bro,” Shaq said. “You got your job, you got your podcast, leave my Angel Reese alone. I’m the one calling her and telling her not to respond, f###### stop it. That’s the last time. OK. Thank you.”\nThe NBA Hall of Famer also took aim at the media’s obsession with fueling a rivalry between Reese and Caitlin Clark, saying the attention is misplaced and harmful.\n“That’s not real hate,” Shaq said, dismissing RG3’s claims that Reese “hates” Clark. He added, “You already spoke on it. Let it go. So what? He hates her. So f###### what? I hate you now for messing with her. Now what?

It remains unclear whether any bullets hit the target.\nCole publicly thanked Troy on Instagram on Tuesday (July 16), crediting him with possibly saving his life.\n“I came home after Celebrating the success of a sold out Chef Fest with Love & support from all over the West Coast!” he wrote. “And a hater from the SAME CITY tried 2 take it all away!

    "description": "T.D. Jakes said he was bombarded by 44,000 AI-generated bots that flooded the internet with false claims tying him toSean “Diddy” Combsand alleged sex parties, calling it a coordinated smear campaign targeting prominent Black public figures.\n\nThemegachurch leaderand media mogul addressed the digital onslaught during a recent interview, revealing the scale of the misinformation push. “When the [rumors] first broke out, it was 44,000 bots that were released on me,” Jakes said. He added that an investigation “discovered that 98% of them were all artificial intelligence-generated.”\nThe rumors, which gained traction online in the wake of multiple lawsuits and criminal allegations against Diddy in 2024 and 2025, falsely linked Jakes to criminal behavior and salacious events.\nHe was named in a lawsuit as someone Diddy allegedly tried to use for image control, but Jakes was never accused of any wrongdoing.\nFake videos and AI-manipulated thumbnails circulated on YouTube, falsely depicting Jakes being arrested or attending parties connected to Diddy. None of the content was supported by credible evidence.\nJakes and his legal team have sincefiled motionsseeking information from YouTube and Google to uncover who is behind the false content. The goal is to identify the individuals or groups responsible for launching the bot-driven attacks.\nJakes made it clear he had no involvement in any of the alleged incidents. “The other thing that it really proved to me, to Oprah, to Denzel, to all the people, is that it’s everybody. It goes along with the turf,” he said. “We have got to stop getting our information from TikTok,” he said.\nA post shared by HOLLYWOOD UNLOCKED (@hollywoodunlocked)\nHe also dismissed the rumors as baseless. “That’s kinda water under the bridge. If there were anything there, the FBI would have been in it … It’s like when I had my health scare—within seconds, it was all over the world, you wouldn’t have to find it on Instagram, you wouldn’t have to find it on YouTube.

    "title": "Kendrick Lamar Scores Four Emmy Nods After Dismantling Drake",
    "description": "Kendrick Lamarearned four Emmy nominations Tuesday (July 15) for his Apple Music Super Bowl LIX Halftime Show, placing him in the running for Variety Special, Directing, Music Direction and Choreography. The high-profile performance, broadcast by Fox, marked another milestone in the Pulitzer Prize winner’s career as he continues to blend commercial success with critical acclaim.\n\nLamar’s halftime set was praised for its sharp visuals and tight execution, adding another layer to his already decorated resume. The Emmy recognition arrives as Lamar remains a central figure in rap’s most talked-about feud of the year.\nHis lyrical war with Drake has dominated headlines since last spring, with both artists trading pointed diss tracks. Lamar’s “Not Like Us” became a cultural moment, with its beat and bars dissected across social media and radio.\nThe track, widely seen as a direct hit at Drake, fueled a wave of response tracks and commentary. The back-and-forth has reignited interest in lyrical competition in Hip-Hop, drawing comparisons to past rivalries. It also sparked Drake’s lawsuit with his label, Universal Music Group, which he accused of defamation and negligence over the release and aggressive promotion of “Not Like Us.”\nThe lawsuit, submitted in January 2025, alleges that Universal’s promotion of the song—which features lyrics insinuating Drake is a pedophile—directly endangered his life and career by fueling public hostility and multiple security threats, including a shooting at his Toronto residence and the circulation of flyers labeling him a predator. The complaint also claims the track’s cover art displayed an aerial photo of Drake’s home, further encouraging harassment and potentially inciting vigilante behavior.\nDrake’s legal team asserts that Universal Music Group leaned into the song’s commercial potential at his expense, leveraging its viral success and cultural impact—bolstered by high-profile Grammy and Super Bowl promotions—to gain negotiating power ahead of contract renewals with both he and Lamar.\nDespite “Not Like Us” becoming a chart-topping hit and cultural milestone, Drake’s lawsuit pointedly targets Universal, not Kendrick Lamar himself, for allegedly prioritizing profit over artist safety and disseminating “false and malicious” narratives. Universal has moved to dismiss the lawsuit, arguing that Drake’s claims are merely an attempt to recover from what they describe as a self-provoked and publicly lost rap battle, while Drake’s counsel maintains that the label is responsible for amplifying dangerous misinformation that has already led to real-world consequences\nWhile the Emmy nominations celebrate Lamar’s artistic achievements on stage, the ongoing tension with Drake keeps his name circulating far beyond award season chatter.\nBeyoncé also landed four nods for her Netflix special,Beyoncé Bowl, which showcased her 2023 Renaissance World Tour performance. The production is up for Variety Special, Directing, Production Design and Choreography. Both specials are now in the Emmy race alongside the 67th Annual Grammy Awards, which scored nominations for Production Design, Lighting Design/Direction, Sound Mixing and Choreography.\nWinners will be announced during the 76th Primetime Emmy Awards on September 14.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "description": "Punch TDEdidn’t hold back whenAkademiks‘ camp stepped over the line again. This time, the account was found targeting SZA, Punch’s artist at Top Dawg Entertainment.\n\nThings escalated after Akademiks’ spin-off account, Akademiks TV, lashed out at SZA in the middle of a Twitter fight with Nicki Minaj. That page (which we know AK oversees) mocked SZA’s mental state and religious beliefs. The account said,“SZA snake ass can’t cry to Drake no more to protect her… She typed them s#### with tears in her eyes crying off the ledge.”WOW.\nThis is where Punch jumps in.“Y’all might want to chill. For real, champ. Let’s just keep it cool this time around or just give me a call, man.”Not sure if they talked, but this feels like a continuum.\nPunch and Akademikshave clashed several times over Akademiks’ criticisms of Black women in rap. SZA happens to be one that is close to him. Punch has routinely checked AK.\nOn social media, Punch pressed Akademiks directly: “Ayo Akademiks, didn’t you say that the you personally write the captions for Akademiks TV or were you capping when you said it?” (I’m paraphrasing.)\nAnd now we get to the part where everybody is focus on: The Nicki Minaj part. After Punch tweeted a new song called “Broken Barbies,” she went after him. The song has nothing to do with Nicki. Here are some of the posts:\nAlthough Nicki directed some of her most vicious rhetoric toward Punch, he did not reply. He’s probably trying to avoid more mess. He’s only talking to another man about SZA.  Seems like Nicki may be trying a legal strategy because she used some interesting terms like“purposefully used to cause financial damages”and“engage in a smear campaign against the brand.”Hmmmm are lawyers reviewing these tweets?\nAkademiks pretty much talked out both sides of his neck. “Nicki on bad timing recently. She ain’t lying either. Everybody just too scared to say the s### she’s saying… She’s only been exposing the demons of this industry.” Uh-Uh.\nHe seems to be co-signing of Minaj’s behavior, but also saying she on “bad timing.” Meanwhile, Akademiks TV doubled down with insults and religious jabs against SZA. They call that “rage baiting.”\nSalute Punch! He appears committed to shielding his team from bullying. I certainly see a different bully than Nicki sees.  He also refused to be baited into warfare. We need to be better about establishing lines that cannot be crossed.\nWishful thinking.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Troy gave a lot of people John Wick vibes. But there’s no official police report, no arrests, no victim updates…nothing.

The whole thing could have been something more tragic – reminiscent ofPop Smokeor PnB Rock.\nThere’s always a “but.” BUT…isn’t Troy Ave a felon? Remember thatTaxstonesituation in 2016? Can felons have gats in Cali? Somehow, I am thinking he would be jammed up if this found its way to the cops. Maybe…that has not happened yet? New York and Cali do not play with their gun laws.\nJackboyswill pop out and not care who you are. Well, they care! They won’t rob me because there’s nothing to take. They want what’s in your pocket, but hopefully they do not want your life.\nStay tuned.

We just heard about OVO affiliate Top5 getting stabbed in the U.K., even though details are still unclear. While that incident doesn’t appear connected to rap, the timing is eerie. Anything can happen.\nThe framing of this as a U.K. vs U.S. showdown feels a bit outdated. It’s not 2007. We need collabs unless there’s friendly competition. Skepta drew a weird line between U.K. rappers and the American South; a comparison that doesn’t really hold up.\nMaybe URL or another battle league steps in andactually organizesa battle.

The post didn’t include a long caption or any direct explanation. But for those tuned into Hip-Hop culture and street history, it didn’t take long to catch the implication. It seems like he was saying this is proof of his claims.\nMany raised eyebrows. Fat Joe is Puerto Rican and Cuban! I just found that out. But did he ever officially study lessons or was he acknowledged by righteous teachers within Five Percent circles?

    "description": "Justin Bieber and Clipse dropped albums on the same day, but only one walked away with a No. 1 spot—and it wasn’t Bieber.\n\nTheCanadianpop star surprised fans withSWAG, his first album in four years, while Virginia duo Clipse made a thunderous return withLet God Sort Em Out. Despite a divided fanbase and little direct competition, the matchup got testy after the numbers came in, and Clipse took the top position. Now, this may not be reflected in the charts of mainstream, but for us…Clipse are No. 1. and Bieber knows it.\nRather than offer congratulations or stay quiet, Bieber decided to post an Instagram Story that took direct aim atPusha TandMalice. Some joker named Kerwin Frost mocked Clipse’s fanbase as “bitter grown men who collect Kaws dolls and shop at Kith and Union.” At first, I thought that was Beebz. But, Bieber opted to repost and add, “This is the only album that matters right now,” in all caps. OH.\nThe post didn’t last long. Bieber deleted it swiftly. But we are going to immortalize it. The move came off salty, in my opinion.SWAGmarked his first release in years and was generally well received. He leaned on rap heavy to make that happen. But taking a jab at Clipse? Bad look.\nBieber is still signed to Def Jam, the same label Clipse left behind. Some folks have suggested the label pushed him to pull the diss, fearing a mess from the brothers. Considering Pusha T’s track record surgical takedowns, he doesn’t want to be the next Canadian on the menu. We remember the Drake situation. Rap has always shown this guy love (just ask Diddy).\nClipse, to their credit, didn’t even respond. They let the people and charts speak for them.Let God Sort Em Outis the No. 1 most talked about album right now. They have the critical acclaim and high-art features.\nBieber has to put his feelings in check. Some have accused him of using drugs. I hope not, but maybe that’s where he and Clipse can have common ground. A fiend and some coke rappers. That may be too far. Anyway, glad both albums are getting good reviews and praise. By the way, Bieber is 31.\nMaybe he should call him “Justin Beefer.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "title": "SIGNS: Black Cyclist Arrested For Shooting His White Attacker—Despite “Stand Your Ground” Law",
    "description": "Reginald Butler was arrested and charged with aggravated assault in Adams County, Mississippi after a white man who allegedly attacked him earlier that day was shot during a second confrontation on a rural bridge, according toreports.\n\nDeputies responded Friday evening (July 11) to reports of a fight near a party on Deerfield Road, but before they arrived, they were informed that a shooting had occurred. Investigators later determined that two separate encounters led to the gunfire.\nIn the first incident, captured partially on video, Butler was seen being beaten by a group of white men. He escaped the attack on a bicycle. About a mile away, one of those men allegedly confronted Butler again on a bridge, exited a vehicle and began assaulting him, witnesses said.\nButler then pulled a firearm and fired multiple rounds, striking the man in the chest and hitting the vehicle once. Both men fled the scene.\nButler was later located at his home and taken into custody. The firearm believed to have been used in the shooting was recovered. The wounded man was transported by emergency crews to Kingston Ball Field, where he was airlifted to a hospital.\nButler was also taken to a hospital by deputies to be treated for injuries from the earlier assault.\nAuthorities identified Cameron Taunton as one of the men involved in the initial beating. He was initially charged with simple assault causing bodily injury. Despite video evidence and witness statements indicating Butler was attacked a second time before he fired his weapon, he remains in custody at the Adams County Jail.\nAdams County Sheriff Travis Patten addressed the community’s growing concerns after the video of the initial assault surfaced.\n“To the individuals whose identities were captured in these videos or whose voices can be heard on the videos, come to the sheriff’s office on Monday first thing, or we will be seeking you out and picking you up,” Patten said. “We are deeply troubled by the recent incident involving the assault on Reginald Butler and the subsequent arrest of all parties involved.\n“The emergence of videos has shed new light on the events that took place that day when three individuals unjustly attacked a man who was simply minding his own business. We recognize the profound pain, anger and frustration this has caused the entire community and we share in the outrage over this injustice. Hate has no place in our society and certainly not in our community that has made so much progress.”\nStill, Patten offered a rationale for Butler’s arrest that some have questioned.\n“The decision to charge Butler with aggravated assault reflects the totality of circumstances at this stage,” Patten said, “including whether the use of force met legal standards for self-defense under Mississippi law. All of this is being reviewed now that the video evidence has emerged and statements have changed.”\nPatten also noted that Butler had attempted to return to the scene of the initial assault, which he initially said factored into the decision to charge him—a claim he later admitted “isn’t completely accurate.”\nMississippi is one of 38 states with a “Stand Your Ground” law, which allows individuals to use deadly force if they reasonably believe it is necessary to prevent death or great bodily harm. Critics have long argued these laws are not applied equally, particularly when Black individuals claim self-defense.\nButler was released on a $50,000 bond on Monday (July 13). Taunton’s charges have been upgraded to aggravated assault and conspiracy to commit aggravated assault. He’s being held on a $350,000 bond.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Details are murky, but multiple unconfirmed sources suggest that Top5 is recovering and survived what some are calling an “assassination attempt.” That’s dramatic, but the streetsaresaying it.\nNow, what makes this even more interesting is the timing.

We know now that it likely came from Ye.\nIn the messages, Push allegedly said, “U let Drake disrespect you, your wife, and your family… that’s why u can’t get your wife to respect u.” This was deep stuff.\nBut the VA don let it be known that he’s not that sort of person to leak texts.\n“Some more other corny sh#t. You ain’t ever see it from me. I don’t leak nothin’, I don’t tell nothin, I ain’t ever done it man. You got to ask the guys who do that,” he said. “Oh, I know exactly who leaked it,” he added. “But they have to have nothing else moving or shaking. They need to do something. I don’t have to leak anything, man. You know, people crazy.”\nPusha has the iciest of veins.\nLet God Sort Em Outis the Clipse’s first album in over 15 years and many regard it as the best album this year. Throughout the project, Pusha jabs at Kanye. Their creative bond might’ve given us some iconic moments in modern Hip-Hop, but the friendship has sunk.\nA post shared by Complex Music (@complexmusic)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "description": "Bhad Bhabielit up social media with a profanity-filled tirade accusing her mother,Barbara Bregoli, of leaking a lawsuit story involving a $674,452.40 credit card debt to the press in what she claims was a deliberate attempt to ruin her image.\n\nThe 22-year-old rapper went live on Instagram Saturday (July 12) to address reports that American Express had filed a lawsuit against her for unpaid credit card debt.\nShe denied the debt and pointed the finger squarely at her mother for spreading the story.\n“My mom did that!” she yelled during the livestream, claiming she had just purchased another home and wouldn’t have been able to do so if she owed that kind of money.\nShe also said she was never served with any legal documents and insisted there was no active case.\nBhad Bhabie didn’t hold back, accusing her mother of trying to publicly humiliate her and sabotage her career. She alleged Barbara was feeding blogs and tabloids with false information and even implied she stole a $75,000 necklace.\n“B#### you are so f###### miserable,” she said, adding that she had once offered to pay for her mother to receive mental health treatment.\nThe rapper also claimed her mother gave birth to her in an attempt to keep a man, who later left, and that Barbara had taken out her frustrations on her daughter for more than two decades.\nA post shared by Watch Live Bitez (@livebitez)\nEarlier this week, Bhabie posted a message on Instagram Stories calling her mother out again.\n“I bought you a million dollar house, you have 2 Benz’s, one Bentley. You still on payroll,” she wrote. “STAY OUT OF MY LIFE, an stop harassing me an my friends and stop spreading false stories to the media outlets because your mad.”\nShe ended the post by telling her mother to move on. “Please STay out of my life Barbara,” she wrote.\nThis isn’t the first time Bhad Bhabie has gone public with accusations against her mother.\nShe previously posted, then deleted, a video showing the two in a heated physical altercation. She’s also accused Barbara’s boyfriend of abuse and claimed she was molested for three years by two individuals, including him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

It was an open invitation to join in on any track he chose.\nWhen Charlamagne asked, “And nothing moved his spirit?” Pusha only said, “I don’t know.” Dag. I wish we could have had gotten that.

    "description": "Gervonta “Tank” Davis is undefeated in a boxing ring. However, outside the ring, the hooks are busting him up.  Legally and morally, we have an issue.ESPNis reporting that Davis, 30, may have assaulted the mother of his childrenat least10 times over the course of their relationship.  The allegations are disturbing and seem to be repetitive.\n\nThis is a pattern.\nThe latest incident, which occurred onFather’s Dayin Doral, Florida, has rumors coming out of the new battery charges. Police allege Davis hit his ex-girlfriend in the back of the head and slapped her outside of her home. That’s the official report. But what’s not in the docket is the history. That is a bit “yet” as well. Sources cited by ESPN say this woman has been on the receiving end of Davis’ fistsmultipletimes over the years. I happen to believe authorities and his children’s mother might be done giving him passes.\nHe is out now, but for how long?\nRight now, these are misdemeanor charges. But the sheer volume of alleged abuse could push prosecutors to elevate this into a felony case. If she “flips” or if they’re pressured to treat Davis like a civilian and not a cash cow. Stars are treated different in the justice system. I don’t want this, but Davis could face real prison time. I hope he gets help! What could be driving him to risk it all like this?\nHis career could also suffer a critical hit.Davis has a fight coming up. And that fight he nearly lost! He got dropped even though they did not count it as such. Taking a knee…is a knock down. That may be one of the reasons the alleged victim hasn’t pursued heavier charges in the past. We know that “do not mess up the money” mantra well!\nDavis has faced trouble before. In 2022, he was arrested for allegedly slapping a woman during a separate domestic incident. Those charges were dropped. How many more before someone steps in? Where is Don King when you need him?\nFocus, Tank!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

People is Kanye West.\nIn a recent sit-down withComplex, Pusha didn’t dodge the elephant in the room.

Caiden, who recently went viral with more than five million views on hisOn The Radarfreestyle, is emerging as a force in his own right.\n\nMeanwhile, Consequence is set to release a new single produced by longtime collaborator Kanye West. The two spoke candidly withAllHipHopabout the state of Hip-Hop, creating music in the TikTok era, their upcoming projects and more. Cons admitted that his son tends to raid the closet, but he had his own as well.\nAllHipHop (Chuck Creekmur):AllHipHop is in the building once again with Consequence and Caiden the Crownholder. You still holding that crown?\nCaiden: No doubt. Absolutely.\nAllHipHop: Since the last time we talked, you had one of theTop 10 Most Viral On the Radarfreestyles on TikTok.\nCaiden The Crownholder:Yeah, it’s at 5.4 million now.\nAllHipHop: That’s what’s up! Hey, man, I gotta ask you this, how does it feel to have a dad that loves you so openly and publicly? It’s documented.\nCaiden: It’s the greatest feeling in the world.\nAllHipHop:That’s what’s up. And, Cons, your son issotalented. You gotta be proud.\nConsequence: Absolutely. This has been the happiest Father’s Day I’ve had. His album is done. We outside this summer.\nAllHipHop: When y’all pulling up to the studio for a full interview?\nConsequence: July.\nAllHipHop: Bet. We’re locked in. Let’s talk music. Caiden, you’re in the game now and it’s a tough space. How are you feeling about the landscape?\nCaiden: I feel pretty good. New things are coming to me. I’m rocking with it. It’s been good lately.\nAllHipHop:Cons, what about you?\nConsequence: You know me. It’s wash, rinse, repeat. These days it’s about being a content creator. TikTok, Instagram—you gotta adjust. Back in the day, you had to learn how to scratch, how to use MySpace. It’s always evolving.\nAllHipHop: So what’s changed?\nConsequence: It’s just a new format, but Hip-Hop’s always been about pushing forward. From “Callin’ Me”to newer music, we’ve taken this thing further than we ever imagined. Like a wise man once said: “We never thought we’d take it this far.” So wehave tokeep going. The road may get rocky, but we know the texture, the sound, the feel. It’s our responsibility to pass that knowledge on to the next generation, like this guy right here. That’s how the tradition stays alive.\nAllHipHop: Respect. It doesn’t always feel like it’s ours anymore.\nConsequence: Nah, I’m not having that. Never have. I’ve never been the type to kick my feet up. It’s boots to the ground with me, always.\nAllHipHop: Let’s talk about the music y’all are creating. What should we expect from the project? Any features?\nConsequence: Absolutely. We’ll be dropping the tracklist soon. He’s 13 and already has incredible records. The charisma, the MCing, the versatility—it’s all there. And yes, we kept some traditional vibes too. I’ll say this—we have a record with me, Caiden, Cory Gunz andPeter Gunz.\nAllHipHop:That’s a classic lineup.\nConsequence: You already know.Cory Gunzcanspit. I’m a rapper’s rapper—but also a songwriter, and I’m always about that check. That’s well documented. But the bars? They’re still there. Just wait until you hear it.\nAllHipHop: I’m familiar. I’m looking forward to that one.\nConsequence: Let’s go!\nAllHipHop: OK, switching gears—I hate to do this, but I gotta ask: What’s up with your boy?\nConsequence: Which one?\nAllHipHop: Let’s start with Kanye. What’s the word?\nConsequence: Let’s save that for the longer sit-down. But when my new single drops—and yes, Ye produced it—we’ll talk. I’ve got the beat of the summeragain. I wasn’t lying last time, and I’m not lying now. This joint is incredible.\nAllHipHop: Say less. Looking forward to it. On the fashion tip, though—you see the drip, the kicks. You stay fresh.\nConsequence: You know how I do.\nAllHipHop: Caiden, what’s your favorite fashion item right now?\nCaiden: Probably myHublotwatch—and of course, the chain.\nAllHipHop: Hublot! Excuse me, young king! Cons, I see the family doing well!\nConsequence: We’re in a great space. Since the last time you saw him, he’s grown up. Now we’re at a point where we wear the same sneakers. I’ve been looking forward to that. It’s a whole new vibe now—double the flavor.\nAllHipHop: Y’all wearing the same size?\nConsequence: Same sneakers, not the clothes yet. But we getting there.\nAllHipHop: That reminds me of my pops. You’ve created something special.\nConsequence: Appreciate that. This is a special moment in time for us. And I can’t wait for people to hear his new album.\nAllHipHop: Spicy?\nConsequence: Spicy. And he’s talkinghoton there, too.\n\n\n",

    "title": "“Squid Game” Actors Park Sung-hoon & Kang Ae-sim Talk Season 3 & Hip-Hop’s Influence",
    "description": "Squid Gameis here and AllHipHop’sD-Nellzcaught up with two of the show’s breakout stars—Park Sung-hoon(Player 120) andKang Ae-sim(Player 149). This exclusive conversation touched on acting, strategy and the cultural impact of Hip-Hop in Korea. The wildly popular Netflix series continues to push boundaries and these two Korean actors bring both emotional depth and cultural insight.\n\nPark Sung-hoon shares how Hip-Hop influenced his personal style growing up and how it still motivates him on set. He recalls bumping tracks by Korean rap legends likeYDG(Yang Dong-geun, Squid Games Season 2)andTANOSduring hisSquid Gameshoot days. Kang Ae-sim, a veteran of Korean theater and screen, offers her thoughtful take on the show’s evolution and the surreal experience of joining the internationally beloved Netflix show.\nThe duo even discusses whether they’d survive in the real Squid Game and who was the class clown on set.\nAllHipHop (D-Nellz): Hip-Hop has become huge across Asia. How has it impacted you personally or creatively?\nPark Sung-hoon:A few years ago, Hip-Hop exploded in Korea—thanks in part to shows likeShow Me The Money. That show gave Hip-Hop a serious spotlight. And it’s wild—two of ourSquid Gamecastmates, TANOS and Yong-sik, are legit Hip-Hop figures. Growing up, I was heavily influenced by Hip-Hop—if you look at old photos of me, I’m rocking oversized gear, big pendants, towels around my neck—just fully in that world. I’ve also worked with a lot of actors who started out as musicians, so I listen to their music while filming. I used to play a lot of YDG and TANOS on my way to set.\nAllHipHop: Kang Ae-sim, do you feel a connection between music—Hip-Hop or otherwise—and acting?\nKang Ae-sim:Absolutely. Music helps unlock emotional energy, and it influences the rhythm of how I approach a role. Even if I’m not immersed in Hip-Hop like Park is, I respect the genre deeply.\nAllHipHop: When you first read the script for Season 3, what was your reaction?\nPark Sung-hoon:Honestly? I was shocked. I didn’t expect a third season, but the script was incredibly tight. It felt like Seasons 2 and 3 were always meant to follow the original. It was that well put together.\nKang Ae-sim:I felt the same way. Season 1 was meant to be the end, but it got so much love, the world expanded. The writing surprised me—it was complex, emotional, and thrilling.\nAllHipHop: Did you feel any pressure knowing the entire world was watching?\nPark Sung-hoon:Not pressure—more like disbelief. It was surreal to realize I was part of something this big. I just focused on doing my best and enjoying the process.\nAllHipHop: If you were in the real Squid Game, would you go solo or build an alliance?\nPark Sung-hoon:[Laughs] One, two, three—build an alliance. I definitely want help. This isn’t a game you want to go through alone!\nAllHipHop: Last question—who’s more serious on set, and who’s more playful?\nPark Sung-hoon:[Laughs] I’ll admit it—I’m the playful one. I love keeping the mood light between scenes.\nKang Ae-sim:And I’m probably the more serious one. But we balance each other out well.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "title": "“Superman” 2025 Offers Light & Fantastical Take On Man of Steel",
    "description": "Chris “Boogie” Brown reviews the latest version of the DC classic superhero.\n\nSuperman, the first film under Warner Bros. Discovery’s new “DC Studios” banner, is directed by James Gunn and stars David Corenswet, Rachel Brosnahan and Nicholas Hoult. Here are my spoiler-free thoughts.\nThe film is set in a fictional universe, wheremetahumanshave been known to society for more than 300 years. Rather than functioning as an origin story, the narrative picks up with Superman already three years into his role as Earth’s protector. The movie serves as a snapshot in time, depicting a chaotic week in the hero’s life as he navigates the duality of his Smallville upbringing andKryptonianheritage.\nSuperman’s relationships, with Lois Lane, his dog Krypt and the public at-large, are explored under the cloud of backlash and scrutiny. A lot of this is orchestrated by the ever-manipulative Lex Luthor. Using social media smears and political influence, Luthor sets out to discredit the Man of Steel permanently. He’s aided byUltraman, a powerful foe, andThe Engineer, a nanotech-enhanced warrior.\nIn response, Superman forms an unlikely alliance with a group of metahumans including Mister Terrific, Hawkgirl, Guy Gardner and a mysterious otherworldly ally. Together, they aim to stop Luthor’s sinister plans.\nGoing into the film with modest expectations, I was pleasantly surprised.Supermanis a solid and enjoyable superhero entry that delivers something new for fans of the character. That said, it’s important to note this movie is tonally distinct from Zack Snyder’s 2013 film,Man of Steel. WhileMan of Steelembraced a grounded and existential tone,Supermanveers sharply toward the fantastical. It’s closer to the spirit ofDC’s Silver Age.\nThe tone is lighthearted, playful and even whimsical, with offbeat humor and vibrant visuals.Supermanaims to evoke the nostalgia of Richard Donner’s 1978 film while feeling like a live-action animated feature. Viewers familiar withSuperman: The Animated SeriesorMy Adventures with Supermanwill recognize the tone instantly. From the classic score to its bright color palette, this is classic material.\nWhile the humor and sci-fi tropes don’t always land, the film embraces its comic book roots unapologetically. Key action sequences involving Superman, Krypto and the Justice Gang offer fun, uneven spectacles.\nThe ensemble cast includes David Corenswet as Clark Kent/Superman, Rachel Brosnahan as Lois Lane and Nicholas Hoult as Lex Luthor. Ed Gathegi plays Mister Terrific and Nathan Fillion is Guy Gardner. Rounding out the cast is Isabela Merced as Hawkgirl, Anthony Carrigan as Metamorpho, Maria Gabriela de Faria as The Engineer and the legendaryWendell Pierceas Perry White. Last, but not least: Skyler Gisondo plays Jimmy Olsen.\nBrosnahan delivers a confident, sharp portrayal of Lois Lane, capturing both her intelligence and spirit. Her chemistry with Corenswet feels genuine. Hoult plays a psychologically unstable, obsessive Lex Luthor with conviction. At times some of his manic moments slide into camp. Ed Gathegi’s Mister Terrific is a standout, while performances by Fillion and Merced felt less memorable.\nCorenswet shines in the dual role. He effectively capturingClark Kent’s modest awkwardness and Superman’s earnest heroism. He looks the part—standing at 6-foot-4—and brings warmth and physicality to the role, even if the suit design isn’t ideal. His performance feels distinct among past portrayals, offering a fresh interpretation of the iconic character.\nStill, the film isn’t without its flaws. Tonally, it sometimes feels like aGuardians of the Galaxyfilm dressed in Superman’s colors. Gunn is well known for directing theGuardians of the Galaxytrilogy for Marvel. The crowded cast occasionally sidelines Superman himself. Visually, the film suffers from inconsistencies, with cinematographer Henry Braham’s ultra-wide lens choices leading to warped or uncanny character appearances in certain shots. Although it’s an improvement over his work onThe Flash(2023), the over-lighting and visual distortions persist.\nDespite those issues,Supermanmanages to balance its story, action, and joyful tone. There is one particularly violent scene involving Luthor, but this is mostly an accessible film that could appeal to all. Reception among hardcore comic book movie fans will likely vary depending on expectations.\nIf you’re partial to the hopeful tone of 1978’sSuperman: The Movie, this may be your film. If you favor the brooding, philosophical depth ofMan of Steel, you might find this version lacking. However, if you’re simply excited to see Superman back on the big screen,Supermandelivers a crowd-pleasing ride.\nThisSupermanfilm carves its own path with a fresh story, distinct tone and colorful direction. As the first entry in the new DC Universe, it packs a big punch.\nSupermanopens in theaters nationwide on (Friday) July 11.\nFINAL RATING: 3.5 out of 5 Stars\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "title": "Trae Tha Truth Talks His Daughter Baby Truth, DJ Screw Legacy, Houston’s Cultural Power & More",
    "description": "Houston Hip-Hop has always marched to the beat of its own slowed-down, candy-painted drum, andTrae Tha Truthis one of its most dedicated generals.\n\nTrae is not only respected in the streets but also globally recognized for his humanity. He’s got those deep, organic ties toDJ Screwand theScrewed Up Click, but is also connected to his tireless community activism.\nNow he blesses us with a new album, Angel, which dripped on his birthday, July 3. The H-Town veteran sat down withAllHipHop‘sDJ Thorofor a heartfelt and candid conversation.\nWith his daughter Baby Truth by his side, Trae discusses the spiritual inspiration behind his new music. He also pays homage to DJ Screw, opens up about his humanitarian work across the U.S. and even imagines his dream collaborations.\nThis conversation peels back the layers of a man who’s as committed to his culture as he is to his calling.\nAllHipHop: First off, I gotta say I’m a big fan. “Swang” with Big Hawk is a classic.\nTrae Tha Truth:Appreciate that. That record brought me to the national level. It defined Houston culture—cars, the sound, and Big Hawk, R.I.P.\nAllHipHop: Let’s talk about your new record “All Right.”\nTrae:Yeah, it features my daughter Baby Truth andLeCrae. It’s all leading up to theAngelalbum.\nAllHipHop: The track has gospel vibes. What inspired that direction?\nTrae:Life. The struggles I’ve faced, especially with my daughter. When things get tough, I pray—and God makes it all right. That’s the message.\nAllHipHop: What do you think about GloRilla winning a BET Award for Best Gospel Artist?\nTrae:I don’t usually comment on stuff that ain’t my business. But if the song impacted people and God used her for that, who are we to judge? That’s how powerful He is.\nAllHipHop: Paul Wall told me Texas artists don’t even have to leave the state to make a living.\nTrae:Facts. We been had our own economy. You could go gold or platinum just in Texas. We created our own independent hustle.\nAllHipHop: That’s rare. In New York, nobody can do that.\nTrae:That’s why I ride so hard for Houston. From Beyoncé and Yolanda Adams toTravis ScottandMegan Thee Stallion. We got legends in every lane.\nAllHipHop: Do you think people mimic Houston’s sound?\nTrae:Some do, but a lot pay homage. People don’t realize Trap Soul stems from what DJ Screw did: slowing down R&B tracks and creating that vibe.\nAllHipHop: So when did you first fall in love with Hip-Hop?\nTrae:My pops was a big fan of gangster rap. We’d hitSoundwavesor Sam Goody every week for new tapes. My mom sang, so I had both R&B and rap in my blood.\nAllHipHop: Your biggest market outside Houston?\nTrae:New York. I could hold my own out there. I’ve got tracks with East Coast cats like Raekwon, Jadakiss, Ross, Jeezy. They respect the artistry.\nAllHipHop: You ever intimidated working with any of your idols?\nTrae:Never. That’s like sparring. I’ve always been ready for the challenge: rapping, harmonizing, lyrical bars, whatever.\nAllHipHop: If you could do a dream collab with any artist, dead or alive, who would it be?\nTrae:DJ Screw. I gotta rep my culture. But if we talk powerhouse collab—Michael Jackson, Pac, Nipsey, Big. I’d make a timeless classic with them.\nAllHipHop: Speaking of Screw, what was your relationship like?\nTrae:I met him at 15 or 16. By 19, I was on Screw tapes with my group Gorilla Mob. He gave us our first taste of radio. He wasn’t just a DJ. He was my brother, my partner, my supporter. We were supposed to sign to his label before he passed. I’ll always carry his legacy.\nAllHipHop: You do a lot for the community. What’s new?\nTrae:I’m always working. Just sent an 18-wheeler full of supplies to help tornado victims in St. Louis. I was helping with the LA fires too. Trade Day is coming up in Houston—July 17 through 21. But now I get calls to help nationwide.\nAllHipHop: Houston gave you the key to the city, right?\nTrae:Two keys, actually. I got awards, belt buckles…stuff I didn’t even know existed. Seven holidays in Houston and one in Milwaukee. But I feel like when I win, we all win. It’s not just me.\nAllHipHop: What inspires your music now?\nTrae:Life. Pain. Growth. I started rapping my brother Dinky’s lyrics when he was locked up. Now I’m decades deep and still here, still relevant.\nAllHipHop: Let’s talk cars. New York got BBS Boys, but y’all got slabs.\nTrae:Man, in Houston, if you ain’t on slabs, you ain’t made it. My brother used to gut the backseat and fill it with speakers, domes, and ride on them swingers. It’s a rite of passage.\nAllHipHop: Your albumAngel. Tell me about it.\nTrae:This one’s special. It’s my prized possession because of what I went through making it. It’s pain, it’s God, it’s soulful. One of the standout joints is“Amen” featuring Dave Chappelle.\nAllHipHop: That’s huge. Any hard copies or vinyl drops coming?\nTrae:Not yet, but Cam Newton just told me I need to. I might drop some limited-edition colored vinyl. It’s time.\nAllHipHop:You got anything on the film side?\nTrae:Yeah, got a movie calledSoleon Tubi. It’s animated and features me. My daughterBaby Truthwants in on the next one, so we working on that too.\nAllHipHop: Final sports question: how you feel about KD on the Rockets?\nTrae:If they mesh right, it could work. Even before KD, our young squad had potential. But now, with KD, Jabari, VanVleet, and the rest—it’s about roles and chemistry.\nAllHipHop: Yo, appreciate you. Happy birthday and salute to Baby Truth.\nTrae:Appreciate you, always love.\n",

    "title": "“Squid Game” Stars Jo Yu-ri & Yim Si-wan Talk Season 3, Hip-Hop Culture & More",
    "description": "The global sensationSquid Gamereturns with Season 3—and joining the brutal competition are new standout cast membersJo Yu-ri(Player 222) andYim Si-wan(Player 333).\n\nIn an exclusive sit-down withAllHipHop’s D-Nellz, the two stars open up about their emotional journeys, the toll of filming, and the pressure of joining the hit series.\nJo Yu-ri, known for her work as a singer, plays a pregnant participant fighting for survival.  Yim Si-wan, a former K-pop idol, brings complex layers to his morally shaky character. Both say the script pulled them in instantly. And, when they got comfortable, they were immersed fully in the story.\nBut this wasn’t just about acting. SinceAllHipHopwas in the room, the conversation naturally shifted toHip-Hop. Korean rap has gained traction globally and both stars revealed their respect for the roots and the culture.\nEast met West in the most authentic way—and the synergy is undeniable.\nAllHipHop (D-Nellz):When you first got the script for Season 3, what was your immediate reaction?\nYim Si-wan:I was completely hooked. I read the entire thing in one go. It was that immersive—I couldn’t stop.\nJo Yu-ri:Same here. It took me about three hours, but I didn’t put it down once. I had to know what happened.\nAllHipHop:Did the global success ofSquid Gamebring added pressure to your performances?\nYim Si-wan:Definitely. At first, I felt that pressure. But once I read the script, it was so well-written that I just told myself: trust the story, trust the director, and trust my castmates. That helped me shift my focus.\nJo Yu-ri:I agree. The expectations were high, but I reminded myself to enjoy the process. Once we started filming, the pressure kind of melted away.\nAllHipHop:What was the most challenging part of filming?\nYim Si-wan:Emotionally, it was tough. My character’s morality is murky. He’s not clearly a good or bad guy. That ambiguity took a mental toll while filming.\nJo Yu-ri:For me, it was also emotionally heavy. My character is pregnant, so beyond just surviving, she’s fighting to protect a child. That added a lot of emotional weight to every scene.\nAllHipHop:Since we’reAllHipHop, we have to ask…how do you both feel about Hip-Hop’s influence in Korean culture?\nYim Si-wan:I have huge respect for Hip-Hop. There are so many amazing artists I admire. It’s a genre that tells the truth in a raw, emotional way.\nJo Yu-ri:I’ve always felt a connection to Hip-Hop—even if I’m more known for pop music. It’s powerful, and I think Korean and Western Hip-Hop are learning from each other every day.\nHead towww.netflix.com/SquidGamefor all the action.\n\n\n\n\n",

    "title": "Squid Game Season 3: Cast & Director Share BTS Details, Insights In Exclusive Interview",
    "description": "Squid Gametook the world by storm in 2021, becoming Netflix’s most-watched series of all time with over 1.65 billion viewing hours in its first month. The Korean survival drama captivated audiences with its brutal social commentary, stunning visuals, and unforgettable characters. Now, after a global phenomenon and multiple Emmy wins,Squid Gamereturns with a highly anticipated third season.\n\nAllHipHop caught up with actorLee Byung-hun, best known for his role as a masked enforcer in the series, directorHwang Dong-hyukand starLee Jung-jae(Player 456, Gi-hun). From slipping back into the signature red wig to the psychological depth of characters like Gi-hun and the mysterious Front Man, the team dives deep into what’s next.\nWith season three promising higher stakes, fans are eager to see how the story expands. The cast reveals how fan’s energy helped shape the new season. InterviewerD-Nellzdigs deep to offer rare insight into the minds behind one of the most captivating shows of the decade.\nAllHipHop:It’s an honor to speak with you all today. Let’s keep things light and spoiler-free. First off, how did it feel to return to the world ofSquid Gameand begin filming again?\nLee Jung-jae (Actor):The first scene I filmed this season was with the red wig and I just couldn’t believe I was wearing it again. I remember laughing a lot in the makeup trailer. It felt surreal. Of course, this all began with Director Hwang’s vision, but I also think the energy and love from the fans played a huge part in bringing us back. I’m really grateful for that. So I put the wig on and gave it my all.\nAllHipHop:As both actors and creators,Squid Gamereceived a massive wave of global attention. Did that impact your creative mindset or add pressure coming into Season 2?\nHwang Dong-hyuk (Director):Absolutely, there was pressure. The show became a global phenomenon, and expectations were incredibly high. But instead of letting that stress me out, I made a conscious effort to turn it into confidence. When we made Season 1, I was filled with doubt—wondering if people would resonate with the story at all. But once I saw how much they embraced it, I realized they connected with the message I wanted to share. That gave me the confidence to tell Season 2 the way I truly wanted, believing that audiences would respond if I stayed authentic.\nAllHipHop:Let’s talk about two of the show’s most complex characters, Gi-hun and the Front Man. Without spoiling anything, what should fans expect from their clash in Season 2?\nLee Byung-hun(The Front Man):Gi-hun and the Front Man actually followed very similar paths. Both were players in the game. Both witnessed betrayal, death, and were forced into situations where they had to take others’ lives. But what’s fascinating is that they ended up in completely opposite places. Gi-hun still believes in humanity and holds onto hope, while the Front Man has turned into a pessimist.\nWhen they confront each other this season, you’ll see that the Front Man still has a faint spark of humanity inside him. As I played him, I really tried to convey that internal struggle. It’s not spelled out directly in the script, but if you look closely, I think viewers will sense that even the Front Man might secretly hope Gi-hun is right.\nAllHipHop:Thank you so much for your time. We can’t wait to see how fans react to this new season.\nCast & Team:Thank you!\nCheck out Squid Game Season 3 on Netflix\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "title": "Tech N9ne’s Origin Story: Blood, Beats, and Becoming a Legend",
    "description": "For decades,Tech N9nehas been a relentless force in Hip-Hop, carving out a unique legacy from the underground to the mainstream. His latest album,5816 Forest, is his most personal yet. An origin story, the saga is told in chronological order, from age 12 to 17. This all happened while living at5816 Forest Avenue in Kansas City, Missouri. Unlike many of his projects, this album is entirely Tech N9ne on the verses, with production handled by a single producer,JPZ.\n\nIn this revealing Q&A, Tech N9ne speaks with AllHipHop’sChuck “Jigsaw” Creekmurabout his breakdancing beginnings, the moment he became Tech N9ne, and escaping a strict home. He went on to to chase his dream and maximize his creative DNA. He also reveals how Lil Wayne ended up on the project as well as the hidden meaning behind his iconic hospital scrubs.5816 Forestmay be the most important album of his life.\nAllHipHop: Let’s talk about5816 Forest, your new album. That’s the address where it all began?\nTech N9ne:Yeah, man.5816 Forestwas my home from age 12 to 17, before I ran away to chase becoming Tech N9ne. This album is my origin story, just like in comic books. It’s all in chronological order. One producer, J.P. PZ. No guests on the verses—just me.\nAllHipHop: Why’d you hesitate to do a solo-only project?\nTech N9ne:I’m big on collabs. I love different vibes and pushing boundaries. At first, I thought doing all the verses myself would be boring. But by the third song, I realized: nah, this is fire. With Tech N9ne, the flows, cadences, beats—everything evolves constantly.\nAllHipHop: What flipped the switch for you? When did you know you were going to be Tech N9ne?\nTech N9ne:There’s a song called “Lola” that explains it. I was just beatboxing on the bus one day and Lola Morris told me, “Stop spitting on people. Write a rap.” I went home, wrote eight bars, came back—and people loved it. Later, my guy Black Walt—he gave me my name—heard my first full song and said, “You’re Tech Nine now.”\nAllHipHop: That led to your first big break?\nTech N9ne:Yep. The song “J Sixes” tells that story. I won a rap contest and got to open forEPMDatKemper Arena. The concert was the same day as my high school graduation. I chose the show. I had on my Jordan 6s, and that night sealed the deal—I was going to be Tech N9ne.\nAllHipHop: That choice says a lot about your mindset.\nTech N9ne:I had already run away from home. My stepfather was strict—a Muslim married to my Christian mom. From 12 to 17, I felt like he was too hard on me. The song “Punishment” breaks all that down. I realized later he was protecting me from the streets, the Bloods, everything around us.\nAllHipHop: Heavy. What did your stepfather think of the song?\nTech N9ne:My brother played it for him. He said, “Tell Donnie [my middle name] thank you.” That meant everything. I was nervous because I talk about when he hit me in the head with money for messing up in school. But that was real. It was my last straw before leaving.\nAllHipHop: You also mention your mother a lot. What role did she play?\nTech N9ne:Everything. She was Christian, but let me be me. She took me to haunted houses, horror movies, all kinds of stuff. She bought me Dracula toys and told me, “They’re just plastic, like GI Joe.” She shaped my love for dark imagery, even though people tried to call me adevil worshipper.She passed in 2014 from lupus.\nAllHipHop: That explains the face paint and scrubs?\nTech N9ne:Yeah. When my mom had seizures, my stepfather would put her in psychiatric wards. I’d visit her, and she’d be in hospital scrubs. That stuck with me. Now I wear them on stage in her honor. The killer clown thing? I was terrified of clowns, so I became one. It’s how I processed fear and flipped it into power.\nAllHipHop: Powerful stuff. You’ve always mixed genres. Do you consider yourself Hip-Hop above all?\nTech N9ne:Absolutely. Everything I do is under the Hip-Hop umbrella. When I work with artists from metal, blues, or anything else, I bring Tech N9ne. I did a song with Gary Clark Jr., blues vibes, and another with Marsha Ambrosius. That’s why my next album is calledDecorated, because I’m a decorated MC.\nAllHipHop: Speaking of collabs…Lil Wayne’s on this album, even though it’s mostly solo. Why?\nTech N9ne:I was trying to do the hook for “Yoda” myself, but it felt off. I hit up Wayne and he killed it. Did variations without even being told. He’s a genius, man.\nAllHipHop: It’s dope to hear this evolution, especially in today’s algorithm-driven music world.\nTech N9ne:That’s real. You either catch things by accident now, or you gotta really follow people. Social media doesn’t always help. Jim Jones? He told you he’s rigging the algorithm. I believe it. He had me dying laughing with Shannon Sharpe.\nAllHipHop: He’s trolling, but it’s working. But for real, this5816 Forestalbum…it feels like a full-circle moment.\nTech N9ne:It is. I almost died out there chasing this dream. Selling dope, running with Bloods, everything. I took a chance. And by the grace of God, I’m still here. This album is for that 12-year-old kid who became Tech N9ne.\nMore from Tech N9ne and AllHipHop…\n\n\n\n\n",

    "description": "WhenDon TripandStarlitodropped the firstStepbrothersmixtape in 2011, they carved out a rare lane in Hip-Hop: a duo built not just on beats and bars but true brotherhood. Now, nearly 15 years later, the Southern spitters return withStep Brothers 4 Life, proving that consistency and chemistry still count in a game built on trends. Their latest project is out andAllHipHopsat down with the pair to discuss the long journey, how Tennessee shaped their sound and why their bond still runs deeper than rap.\n\nWhat follows is a hilarious, insightful and sometimes deep dive into everything from PlayStation versus promotion to firearm philosophy. With these two, realness comes first. Watch the video for the full, unedited conversation.\nAllHipHop: Y’all are running at a high level creatively, but you said you were “hanging on by a thread.” What’s going on?\nDon Trip: I ain’t have my nap. That’s all it is.\nStarlito: We’re in grind mode. The album’s done. Now it’s about presentation and marketing—travel, little sleep, and no naps.\nAllHipHop: So let’s talkStep Brothers 4 Life. Why the long gap?\nStarlito: Life. It’s been eight years sinceStepbrothers 3, but when we finally locked in, it only took six weeks. We had six studio sessions and came out with 16 tracks.\nDon Trip: We always record these in person. We don’t do the phoned-in thing. That’s our secret sauce.\nAllHipHop: You can hear that connection. Most people can’t even rehearse together, let alone build like that.\nStarlito: A lot of groups grow apart. But we grew closer—weddings, funerals, kids’ birthdays—we’ve been there for each other in life, not just rap.\nDon Trip: There’s no ego between us. No big “I’s” or little “u’s.” We move like a team.\nAllHipHop: Who was the first Tennessee rapper that influenced y’all?\nDon Trip: For me, it wasThree 6 Mafia,Playa Fly,Gangsta Blac—all at once. I grew up hearing them together.\nStarlito: A rapper named La Mike. He was from East Nashville, got his haircut at my cousin’s shop. That’s when I realized, “Oh, someone from around here is a rapper.”\nAllHipHop: People don’t realize how far Nashville and Memphis are from each other.\nDon Trip: It’s three and a half hours. We ain’t neighbors.\nStarlito: Memphis is more of a Hip-Hop hotbed. Nashville’s country music business. I went to Tennessee State and that helped me build bridges. But yeah, outsiders assume we’re from the same place.\nAllHipHop: We’ve talked about maturity. Hip-Hop’s over 50. Where do y’all think it’s headed?\nDon Trip: I don’t think gatekeeping matters anymore. Now, anyone can upload music. That’s good and bad, but it’s easier for real artists to find a lane.\nStarlito: We have to own our influence. Hip-Hop’s getting fused with country, pop—you name it. And the stuff with a message is disappearing. It’s on us to tell real stories and preserve the culture.\nDon Trip: Substance outlasts trend. We’re focused on giving people music that speaks to something real, not just chasing what’s hot.\nAllHipHop: How do y’all feel about the marketing side of things—videos, social media?\nDon Trip: It’s like maintaining a house. You want the house, you gotta fix the roof. You want the career, you gotta do the work.\nStarlito: Marketing is storytelling. If I can get 3 minutes of your time, maybe I can get you to listen to 51 minutes. We’ve had to do everyone’s job at some point—PR, camera, engineering—you name it.\nAllHipHop: Do y’all go back and listen to the oldStepbrotherstapes?\nDon Trip: Not really. I don’t even look at old pictures. I don’t want to get stuck in the past. My glory days are ahead of me.\nStarlito: Too much reflection can hold you back. You start comparing numbers, chasing old sounds. That’s a trap. We’re building forward.\nAllHipHop: Let’s lighten it up. Top 5 Hip-Hop duos?\nDon Trip: Kriss Kross, Ball & G, Clipse, CNN and I’ll say me and ‘Lito.\nStarlito: UGK, Outkast, Run-DMC, Boosie and Webbie, and yeah—me and Trip.\nAllHipHop: Y’all included yourselves?\nStarlito: Why not? The chemistry is real. We’re in that conversation.\nAllHipHop: Final random topic: guns. Don, you got a favorite?\nDon Trip: I got like 200. It’s therapeutic. Like painting. Hitting the same hole in a target 30 times? That’s art.\nAllHipHop: So it’s a creative thing?\nDon Trip: Yeah. It’s about control and precision. I teach my kids how to shoot. It’s not about violence—it’s about understanding power and being responsible with it.\nStarlito: You talk to him long enough, you’ll be Googling calibers by the end of the day.\nAllHipHop: Final thoughts?\nDon Trip:Stepbrothers 4, out now. We touring, adding cities daily.\nStarlito: We appreciate the love. This ain’t no trend. It’s a movement.\n\n",

    "title": "DMC, John Leguizamo, La Borinqueña & Edgardo Miranda-Rodriguez’s Ever-Expanding Superhero Universe",
    "description": "Edgardo Miranda-Rodriguezis not your typical comic book creator.He’s a cultural architect, a community-rooted storyteller, and a Puerto Rican superhero universe builder. Best known forLa Borinqueña, Edgardo has spent nearly a decade crafting a universe that uplifts Afro-Latinx identity while boldly addressing the racial void in mainstream comics. Long before launching his own IP, he cut his teeth working with legends likeDarryl “DMC” McDanielsof Run-DMC and actor John Leguizamo, helping them bring their visions to life in graphic form. His creation,La Borinqueña, is more than a comic book; it’s a movement rooted in diaspora pride, family, and independence. And yes, he just dropped an action figure too. We caught up with Edgardo atFan Expo in Phillyto talk about owning your narrative, working with Hip-Hop royalty, turning down Hollywood, and the kind of cookies DMC used to bring to the comic conventions.\n\nAllHipHop: For the people that don’t know, who are you?\nEdgardo Miranda-Rodriguez:I’m the writer and creator of the graphic novel seriesLa Borinqueña.I’ve been doing this for nine years now, independently, out of my own studio. Before launching my own IP, I worked with legends like Darryl McDaniels and John Leguizamo—creating entire comic book universes for them. That gave me the confidence to build my own.\nAllHipHop:What lessons have you picked up along this journey?\nEdgardo:Flexibility. Evolution. Collaboration. Those three things. You have to be flexible when you’re indie—publishing when you can, building your own model. I wear all the hats: storyteller, creative director, publicist, marketer. And the biggest lesson? Power comes from community. I created a Black Puerto Rican superhero, so naturally our fans include Black folks, the Latin community, the Caribbean… we’ve found love across the diaspora.\nAllHipHop:That’s deep. Nine years and still buzzing. What’s next?\nEdgardo:We’re coming up on our 10-year anniversary. We’ve got a new comic dropping—introducing a giant robot calledAnte, which means “giant” in Spanish. It’s part of a larger expanded universe we’ve been quietly building.\nAllHipHop:A wholeLa BorinqueñaUniverse?\nEdgardo:Yup. We’ve created our own cinematic universe—on paper first. And it’s a family affair. My son, who’s about to be a senior at Connecticut College, is out here right now managing the sales booth. That’s legacy.\nAllHipHop:That’s beautiful. Speaking of legends, what was it like working with DMC of Run-DMC?\nEdgardo:Man, that was one of the most fun and inspiring experiences of my life. Darryl has this youthful, 16-year-old gleam when he talks comics. It wasn’t a vanity project—he really loves the culture.\nAllHipHop:Any memorable moments from those days on the road?\nEdgardo:[Laughs] Oh yeah! One time, you and I got this futuristic SUV in L.A., and neither of us could figure out how to start it. It felt like we were sitting in the USS Enterprise. You eventually got us on the road! But the best part was Darryl always looked out—he’d bring us cookies at conventions. Real oatmeal joints!\nAllHipHop:That man is the Hip-Hop Cookie Monster.\nEdgardo:And a healer. Most people don’t know this, but when we started touring, DMC had literally lost his voice. We watched it come back in real time. He got so much joy from doing these comics, it was like therapy. That’s how powerful storytelling is—it brought his voice back.\nAllHipHop:Incredible. I’ve seenLa Borinqueñacharacters at Comic-Con. What about a film?\nEdgardo:Listen, who wouldn’t want to see their creation on the big screen? But let’s be real—studios invest hundreds of millions and want toownyour IP. That’s not an option for me.La Borinqueñais like the daughter I never had. If a studio tried to whitewash her? Nah. She’s Afro-Latina. Period.\nAllHipHop:So no Hollywood sell-out?\nEdgardo:Never. I’m a father. I’m a creator. And I’m loyal to our fans. I’ve turned down deals because they came with too much compromise. I’ll wait until the right opportunity comes—one where I’m still at the table.\nAllHipHop:You’ve done more than just create a comic—you’ve built a movement.\nEdgardo:Facts. It’s not just about entertainment—it’s about empowerment. Representation. Pride. Ownership. We’re building our own tables. And we’re setting the place cards for our community.\n\n\n\n\n",

    "title": "Seven Wonders Of The Hip-Hop World: Part II—7 Albums That Changed Rap History",
    "description": "Shad Reedgoes back down the rabbit hole with seven more albums that changed Hip-Hop.\n\nInpart deuxof mySeven Wonders of the Hip-Hop World, I name seven more albums—this time spanning from the mid-90s to the 2010s. (Longevity is one of the factors I considered. So, while more modern, anything newer still has to stand the test of time before being placed in any “all-time” conversation.)\nAs indicated in Part I of this write-up, there was a “winning” list of theSeven Wonders of the Modern World, but it was very controversial. In a nutshell, it was 22 finalists voted down to seven.\nThat said, here are a few albums that didn’t makemy picksfor the modern seven but would still receive no objection to being placed there:The Infamous,The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill,Capital Punishment,Trap Muzik,Get Rich or Die Tryin’, andTha Carter III, to name a few.\nThis album perfectly balances Tupac’s complex personality. His ability to present strength in vulnerability (“Dear Mama”), as well as his “just don’t give a f###” attitude (“F### the World”) is astonishing.Me Against the Worldis Pac’s most well-rounded collection of music. His follow-up,All Eyez On Me, was of course a gargantuan success. Still, I interpret that (despite all the controversy surrounding his move to Death Row Records) as more of a victory lap stemming from the credibility and connections he made with the public through this release. Right from the jump, the way the album starts with the intro and flows into “If I Die 2Nite” with “A coward dies a thousand deaths, a soldier dies but once”—damn!\nDespite taking 10 years to sell 1.5 million copies, Jay-Z’s debut, in the eyes of many, remains his magnum opus. While the hustling themes were nothing new, this album delved into the emotional toll such activity took on a person. That, coupled with the temptations of such a lifestyle (which also get addressed), makes for a captivating listening experience. “Can I Live,” with its Isaac Hayes sample, is a standout, as well as the DJ Premier-produced “D’Evils.”\n\nInUnbelievable: The Life, Death, and Afterlife of the Notorious B.I.G., author Cheo Hodari Coker perfectly compares Biggie’s debut and this second album to the first twoTerminatorfilms. Both are equally significant, but the latter is grander in scale and scope. And at a time when Hip-Hop was mourning (2Pac died in September ’96, and Biggie died just two weeks before this album’s release in March ’97),Life After Deathserved as an olive branch for the rap community too, featuring collaborations with a wide range of artists such as Bone Thugs-n-Harmony, Too Short, and D.M.C., among others.\nThis is the best—right in the center of a perfect four-album run by Big Boi and André 3000. AllHipHop.com co-founderGrouchy Greg Watkinssummed the album up perfectly in a 2013 article:“Aquemini is a Hip-Hop classic that pushes the limits of what we normally consider Hip-Hop, yet is decidedly true to its roots.”When Three Stacks famously stated, “The South got something to say. That’s all I got to say,” they let the music do the talking. And it all led up to this just a few short years later: a flawless musical statement that remains unrivaled and continues to inspire fans and artists alike.\nThis album transcended Hip-Hop and became a fixture in mainstream culture. Fortunately, it also lived up to the hype. The masterful bait-and-switch of “The Real Slim Shady” dominating radio and MTV got millions to purchase the album—and in return, listeners got a commercial song and seventeen more tracks filled with personal and uncensored insight into Eminem’s emotions, struggles, and the pressures of newfound fame. He also reconciled with issues in his personal life. The album is funny, brutal, entertaining, and honest all at once.\nAfter damaging his reputation by interrupting Taylor Swift at the MTV VMAs (which pales compared to Ye’s more recent controversies), Mr. West retreated to Hawaii to begin work on his fifth album. The result was an unexpected masterpiece that exceeded all expectations. Building on stadium sounds first explored withGraduation’s“Stronger,” he upped the ante with songs like “Power.” The epic “All of the Lights” reportedly took two years to create. He even responded to being mocked onSouth Parkby threatening to choke the show’s writers with a fish stick on “Gorgeous.” And the guests? They all got time to shine—Nicki Minaj’s “Monster” verse, Jay-Z’s bar on “So Appalled,” and even Chris Rock’s ad-libs on “Blame Game” add to an already astonishing blockbuster. Sadly,MBDTFdidn’t even receive a nomination forAlbum of the Yearat the 54th Annual Grammys.\nTo Pimp a Butterflysolidified Kendrick Lamar as the voice of his generation. Influenced by a trip to Africa, infused with vast musical input, and filled with socially conscious lyrics—no stone was left unturned. Highlights include “Alright,” which became a protest anthem for the Black Lives Matter movement, and “King Kunta,” where Kendrick addresses ghostwriting with lines like:“I swore I wouldn’t tell / But most of y’all sharing bars like you got the bottom bunk in a two-man cell.”Then there’s the closer, “Mortal Man”—one of the most powerful conclusions to any LP. Clocking in at just over 12 minutes and closing with a faux interview with 2Pac, it brings the album full circle. Despite subverting traditional song structures, it remains one of the most respected tracks in Kendrick’s already outstanding catalog.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "description": "At this year’sFan Expo in Philadelphia, AllHipHop’sChuck “Jigsaw” Creekmurcaught up with one of the most influential creative voices in television, comics and pop culture—Rodney Barnes.\n\nBarnes is known for his work onThe Boondocks,Everybody Hates Chris, and more recently his acclaimed horror comicKilladelphia.  He continues to leave a deep imprint across multiple mediums, including the acclained Lakers seriesWinning Time: The Rise of the Lakers DynastyWith a resume, ahem CV, that includes screenwriting, producing, and crafting iconic characters, his storytelling brilliance stretches from animated satire to the supernatural.\nIn this candid conversation, Barnes opens up about his East Coast roots, the evolution ofThe Boondocks, adapting comics for the screen and his enduring love for Swamp Thing. He explains why authenticity and connection still matter in Hollywood. Delve into the mind of a true culture-shaper.\nAllHipHop:Chuck Creekmur here with AllHipHop andCertified Squad. We’re here with Rodney Barnes—the legend, the writer, the storyteller. What else are you nowadays?\nRodney Barnes:Just writer / producer primarily. I mean, TV more than anything else, but I got this love for comic books that I just can’t let go.\nAllHipHop:Much respect. A lot of people don’t knowThe Boondocksis on your résumé.\nRodney Barnes:We don’t do résumés anymore. [Laughs] Just LinkedIn now.\nAllHipHop:How you doing, man?\nRodney Barnes:I’m good, just busy here in Philly. I try to hit the East Coast towns once a year since I live in L.A.—Baltimore, Philly, D.C. I love coming to these cities.\nAllHipHop:What about New York?\nRodney Barnes:We do New York every year. It’s always wild—kind of like San Diego [Comic-Con].\nAllHipHop:How’s Fan Expo going for you?\nRodney Barnes:It’s not as busy on Sunday, but Friday and Saturday were great. Those are always the hot days for business.\nAllHipHop:Let’s talk about your work. You’ve got several titles out. Have any been converted into shows yet?\nRodney Barnes:Killadelphiahas been optioned. That’s the one people ask about most.Levantine Filmsoptioned it. We’re doing our best to get it set up, just shopping it around.\nAllHipHop:Killadelphiais such a dope concept. Why Philly?\nRodney Barnes:I loved the name. When I was a kid in the Boy Scouts, we’d come to Philly for field trips—see the Liberty Bell, all that history. Juxtaposing the idea of democracy with the social ills of today—it felt like the perfect setting.\nAllHipHop:Delaware wasn’t hard enough for you? [Laughs] We used to call Wilmington “Kilmington.” [For the record, I never did that.]\nRodney Barnes:[Laughs] Philly sounds a lot harder. But I actually have an idea for something set in Delaware. Can’t say it on camera yet, though.\nAllHipHop:Now aboutThe Boondocks. Any chance it comes back?\nRodney Barnes:Never say never. But it’s a different time now. Back then, social media wasn’t like it is today. Now you can offend someone and they’ll jump on Twitter—or “X”—immediately. Corporations don’t like that. We had way less oversight back in the day.\nAllHipHop:It’s a whole new world. How do you feel aboutThe Boondocksbeing a part of your legacy?\nRodney Barnes:Very proud. I was doingMy Wife and KidsandEverybody Hates Chrisduring the day, then working onThe Boondocksat night. It was a great mix that helped me find my voice as a writer.\nAllHipHop:What are you most proud of overall?\nRodney Barnes:Just being able to do it this long. Making a living through creativity. If you’d told 8-year-old me that I’d be doing comics, TV, and film, I’d have called you crazy. But I did it—coming from Maryland to L.A., and actually making it work.\nAllHipHop:I see you with everybody—Xzibit was one recently.\nRodney Barnes:[Laughs] When you grow up in a small town, friendships just happen. But in Hollywood, it’s different. I value real relationships, People who love their families, who you can relate to. If we can build together and make money? Even better.\nAllHipHop:Final question—favorite superhero growing up?\nRodney Barnes:Swamp Thing. Then Batman. I liked the darker stuff, especially when it leaned into horror.Bernie WrightsonandLen Wein’sSwamp Thingfrom the ’70s, then Alan Moore’s run—that was my favorite. I’ve writtenBatman, but one day IwillwriteSwamp Thing.\nAllHipHop:That’s dope. Rodney, thank you, brother.\nRodney Barnes:Thank you, man. Appreciate you.\nFor more on Fan Expo, go here.\n\n\n",

    "title": "Tom Cruise’s “Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning” Is Summer Block Buster We Need",
    "description": "A Non-Spoiler Review ofMission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning By Chris “Boogie” Brown\n\nMission: Impossible – The Final Reckoningis the eighth installment in the nearly 30-year franchise starringTom Cruiseand once again directed by Christopher McQuarrie.\nThis film picks up after the events of 2023’sDead Reckoningand serves as a direct sequel. It follows the IMF team, led by Ethan Hunt, as they continue their mission to stop the rogue AI system known as the Entity. Now more powerful than ever, the Entity can control the world’s digital systems, disable defense networks, collapse economies, and undermine entire governments. The IMF must race against the clock to deactivate it before a global war ensues.\nFinal Reckoningis an excellent film that delivers all the thrills viewers have come to expect from theMission: Impossiblefranchise. The sheer scope and scale of this globe-trotting chapter are massive, with top-tier production values throughout. While it doesn’t feature quite as much action as some previous entries, it is no less entertaining. This time around, the film leans more into its political thriller and espionage roots, driven largely by dialogue and timely themes surrounding artificial intelligence. The clever screenplay, penned by McQuarrie andErik Jendresen, explores tension, paranoia, and our collective anxieties about technology.\nOne of my favorite aspects of the film is how it pays homage to the entire franchise through flashbacks, returning characters, and clever plot tie-ins. If you haven’t seen all six of the earlier films, this one does a decent job of catching you up. Still, youmustwatchDead Reckoningto fully grasp the central plot here. Among all the entries, this may be the most emotional—featuring rich character arcs and heartfelt chemistry among the team. Despite the larger-than-life action, the story never loses its emotional core.\nMcQuarrie once again delivers a masterclass in direction, balancing the film’s intricate plot with stunning locales, breathtaking action, and genuine emotional weight. As with his previous films—Rogue Nation,Fallout, andDead Reckoning—he draws standout performances from his cast in every type of scene. His visual storytelling shines through elegant camera work, seamless transitions, and smooth editing. The cinematography by Fraser Taggart is nothing short of breathtaking, capturing both the tension and the spectacle.\nAs for the action, while the sequences are more spaced out, they’re no less effective. Expect close-quarters hand-to-hand combat, high-stakes escapes, gunfights, and chase scenes. But the real standouts are two massive set pieces—one involving a submarine, the other a pair of biplanes. The horror, claustrophobia, tension, and sheer adrenaline packed into these sequences are amplified by the film’s stellar sound design, score, and visual effects. The scale and danger feel incredibly real, a testament to the craftsmanship and safety that must’ve gone into them. These are sequences thatdemandto be seen on the biggest screen possible.\nThe film features a stellar ensemble cast, blending familiar faces and newer additions. Standouts include Ving Rhames as Luther, Simon Pegg as Benji, Angela Bassett as President Sloan, Henry Czerny as Eugene Kittridge, Hayley Atwell as Grace, Pom Klementieff as Paris, Tramell Tillman as Captain Bledsoe, and Esai Morales as Gabriel. Everyone brings something unique to the table, whether in dramatic moments, action sequences, or scenes of levity. Still, when it comes to pure charm, emotional intensity, and action hero grit, the standout is—no surprise—Tom Cruise.\nAfter nearly three decades of playing Ethan Hunt, Cruise’s commitment toMission: Impossiblespeaks for itself. His full-throttle performance combines physical intensity, nuanced acting, and fearless stunt work. At almost 63 years old, he’s still performing demanding stunts with discipline and precision. His dedication to making audiencesfeellike what we’re watching is real is something rare in Hollywood today. Cruise truly is the last of a dying breed—and he showsnosigns of slowing down.\nIf I had one critique, it’s that the film leans too heavily on exposition at times. While necessary for viewers who haven’t seen all the previous films, it occasionally bogs down the pacing. The three-hour runtime, while not a dealbreaker, could have been tightened to make the story feel more efficient.\nStill,Final Reckoningproudly upholds the legacy of theMission: Impossiblefranchise and delivers adrenaline-charged thrills from start to finish. From direction and cinematography to acting, technical execution, score, and spectacle—this is easily one of my favorite films of 2025. Whether or not it’s the last entry, the series, if it ends here, concludes on an incredible high note.\nI’ve loved every film in this franchise since Brian De Palma’s original in 1996. Sure, some are better than others, and fans will always debate their rankings—but one thing has always been true: Tom Cruise hasnevershort-changed fans. If this is his final mission, he stuck the landing in legendary fashion.\nMission: Impossible – The Final Reckoninghits theaters everywhere on May 23 and comeshighly recommended. Enjoy!\n4.5 out of 5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "title": "Seven Wonders Of The Hip-Hop World: Part I—7 Albums That Changed Rap History",
    "description": "Writer Shad Reed gets past the trends and into the immortal albums that have shaped Hip-Hop.\n\nAn onslaught of Hip-Hop “Mount Rushmores” has recently flooded social media and various internet spaces to continue the never-ending debate of “the best.” However, with all due respect to the four faces on that sculpture in South Dakota, a more appropriate equivalent, given Hip-Hop’s rich history, is the Seven Wonders of the World.\nUnlike the faces of the four former presidents, who were people etched in stone onMount Rushmore, there’s no official list of the Seven Wonders of the World. A German scholar named Wilhelm Heinrich Roscher acquired a list of 18 known lists of wonders of the ancient world. Roscher’s findings, first published in1906, only identified two identical ones (one of which was suspected to be a copy of the other) of the eighteen lists.  Roescher’s research also revealed that there were 22 names and 82 places.  In the early 2000s, a foundation in Switzerland conducted a worldwide poll to determine “the Seven Wonders of the Modern World.” While one list emerged, it still received criticism because it allowed people to cast multiple votes, which was deemed unscientific. Plus, the seven winners came from 22 candidates, which began with 77—still lots of room for interpretation.\nTherefore, whether Hip-Hop or historical landmarks, there’s no right or wrong answer if the passion is genuine. It all comes down to defending the choices made. And so, here are seven albums that many agree changed rap for the better. And just as there are “Seven Wonders of the Ancient World” and “Seven Wonders of the Modern World,” it’s only right that Hip-Hop albums receive two separate collections, too. These are not ranked either but instead presented in chronological order. Stayed tuned for Part II.\nWhile Run-DMC’s eponymous debut is a classic, it wasn’t until their third offering that Run, DMC and Jam Master Jay perfected, to paraphrase a line from “My Adidas,” taking the beat from the street and putting it on TV.  It’s also a masterclass in song concepts, most notably “It’s Tricky” (a rap song about how hard it is to rhyme) and “Walk This Way,” a cover and collaboration with the record’s originators, Aerosmith, proving that rap wasn’t something to be feared but embraced.\nRakim is regarded as the “God MC” because of the skillset he demonstrated here.  His esteemed lyricism set a bar that rappers today are still trying to match (and very few have). The production perfectly emphasized his words, and Rakim elevated rap from rhyming on a beat to delivering poetry over music.Paid in Fullis the first album showing that rap albums are truly an art form, not just a collection of records. The game hasn’t been the same since.\nPublic Enemy’s second album proved that Hip-Hop can bring about social change. The project’s uptempo feel brought an energy to it that was previously unseen and ultimately made it that much more effective. Chuck D’s commanding voice, Flavor Flav’s charisma and The Bomb Squad’s sonic landscapes created a sense of urgency that no one could avoid.\nOther Native Tongues albums from artists like The Jungle Brothers, De La Soul and Queen Latifah preceded this. However, during this sophomore set from Tribe, the movement reached its apex. Drums. Jazz samples. Creative and conscious lyrics. No matter how anyone checked the rhyme, A Tribe Called Quest was always on point. Last but not least, “Scenario” introduced Busta Rhymes to the mainstream with one of the most legendary guest verses in rap history.\nThe Chronicalbum is one of the best albums ever produced in any genre, not just Hip-Hop. Dr. Dre’s mastery behind the boards is on full display; his ability to make aggressive content sound smooth was unprecedented. Additionally, the chemistry with Snoop Dogg that was already apparent from “Deep Cover” continued its evolution and resulted in some of the best Hip-Hop music ever. Therefore, it is no surprise that in 2019 the Library of Congress selected the album for preservation in the National Recording Registry.\nAtop cinematic beats and some cool samples (including the theme song to “Underdog”), Hip-Hop maestro The RZA assembled a nine-man collective, whose debut reflected the gritty New York streets in a truly original way. Inspired by Eastern cinema and kung-fu, how he incorporated those elements in his and fellow rhymesayers’ depictions of their humble upbringing is nothing short of brilliant. “C.R.E.A.M.” is slang that Wu introduced, which still hasn’t gone out of style, and “Protect Ya Neck” is arguably one of the greatest debut singles spawned from the Hip-Hop genre.\nWithIllmatic, Nas fulfilled the promise he showed on Main Source’s “Live at the BBQ” and “Back to the Grill.”  With lyrical abilities unseen since Rakim, the 10-track LP was already something spectacular. The icing on the cake, though, was that he also assembled all of the top New York producers to create a cohesive album that came together perfectly. Even in Nas’ famous battle with JAY-Z, Jigga had to tip his hat to this fantastic release. “Four albums in 10 years, n####? I could divide/That’s one every, let’s say two, two of them s#### was doo/One was nah, the other wasIllmatic/That’s a one hot album every 0 year average.”\nTo Be Continued…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "title": "Calvin Ross Wins Best R&B Artist of The Year Award and is “Cuttin Up” This Summer With 2c’s",
    "description": "https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZP8h6VyDg\n\nCalvin Ross is an accomplished R&B singer and producer from Tennessee. Recently, he received the Best R&B Artist of the Year award from Black Only LLC in Atlanta, GA, having previously won the same accolade in 2022.\nThe artist just released a new hit single titled “Cuttin Up” featuring 2c’s. Following the ascent of their debut EP to No. 30 on the iTunes Charts, they released “Cuttin Up,” a dynamic single that combines a hip-hop edge with R&B soul. The track evokes dark, cinematic chords and an epic, stadium-ready beat that captivates listeners from the very first bar and maintains its grip throughout.\nThe production was mainly programmed by Drum Squad Records producer Chriz Beatz, Calvin Ross layered the drum pattern, and 2c’s also played a major role with the instrumental. Which opens on an eerie chord progression, laying the groundwork for a relentless, anthemic rhythm. Layered over pulsing kicks and crisp snares, the instrumentation shifts with dynamic flourishes—subtle hi-hat rolls giving way to bold stabs of melody. This sonic architecture provides a dramatic backdrop for Ross and 2c’s razor-sharp flows, each verse characterized by tight delivery and unbridled intensity.\nListeners will find themselves swept up in the track’s momentum: the chorus builds into an irresistible surge of energy, primed for turn-up moments and late-night drives alike. “Cuttin Up” balances introspective lyricism with commanding bravado, highlighting both artists’ knack for crafting memorable hooks and punchlines that land with precision.\nTheir collaboration not only reaffirms their chemistry but also demonstrates artistic growth, expanding upon the bold experimentation of their first EP while maintaining the accessibility that won over fans worldwide. With “Cuttin Up,” Calvin Ross and 2c’s deliver a single guaranteed to energize playlists, clubs, and airwaves this summer.\nABOUT CALVIN ROSS\nCalvin Ross was unfortunately taken from his parents at the young age of just a few months, along with his older sister, Domonic Ross, and placed into foster care. He remained in the same foster home with six other children until he turned nine, at which point his paternal grandparents relocated him to Detroit.\nCalvin began his music journey at the age of 17, shortly after returning to Tennessee following a six-year stay in Detroit. He obtained a friend’s music setup for $100, which allowed him to start creating beats using Fruity Loops. Once he became familiar with producing his own beats, he leveraged his singing talent and began recording and mixing his music.\n“I didn’t want to release any music until it sounded really good,” he stated.\nAfter winning a showcase at P. Diddy’s studio, Daddy’s House, Calvin Ross had the opportunity to meet with an A&R representative from Def Jam Recordings, who further validated his abilities. Following this encounter, he began to take his music career more seriously and has since achieved remarkable success.\nCurrently, Calvin Ross lives in Atlanta, where he primarily produces Urban R&B music, drawing inspiration from artists such as Michael Jackson, Usher, Ginuwine, and R. Kelly.\n“The feeling I get when someone sincerely tells me they enjoy my music is the best feeling in the world,” Ross expressed. “I let the instrumentals communicate with me and guide my lyrics.”\nHaving grown up in a Tennessee neighborhood where crime and violence are prevalent, Calvin Ross possesses a vibrant story to share—one that continues to distinguish his music from others.\nTo date, he has opened for artists like Avant, Urban Mystic, YFN Lucci, Yung Bleu, and Snootie Wild, and he relentlessly pursues his aspiration of having his music reach the No. 1 spot on Billboard.\nABOUT 2c’s\n2c’s hails from Jackson, Tennessee, where music flowed through his family’s veins from day one. His uncle, “Big Chuck,” kept him up to date with every new release—36 Ball & G, DJ Squeaky, Dayton Family—and his parents filled the house with old-school blues around the clock. Growing up, his world revolved around these sounds, even as he navigated the streets.\nAt 15, 2c’s streetwise hustle led him to Young Mexico’s studio, where he first laid vocals over hard-hitting beats. Watching Mexico perform on BET’s 106 & Park, he realized success beyond his hometown was possible. This moment ignited his drive to pursue music as more than a pastime.\nFor 2c’s, music has always been about legacy, not money. He aims to leave an enduring imprint for his children and family, believing that music heals and uplifts the soul. His creative philosophy is rooted in authenticity and the transformative power of sound.\nHis musical influences span Southern rap and beyond: Young Dolph, Future, Three 6 Mafia, and Ball & G shaped his lyrical style, while working around Drumma Boy taught him the importance of surrounding himself with the right collaborators. In the studio, he and co-producer/engineer Chriz Beatz lock in to sculpt fresh, boundary-pushing sounds—Beatz remains his go-to engineer for realizing his vision.\nA true multi-hyphenate, 2c’s is a rapper, songwriter, producer, and composer. He began making beats as a backup plan, but his talent quickly led to credits with major artists: Ludacris, Megan Thee Stallion, Daedae, Jay Fizzle, Big Moochie Grape, Dej Loaf, BAK J, FBG Murda, Young Buck, and many more. Today, 2c’s stands as both artist and architect, crafting tracks that resonate long after the last note fades.\nConnect:\nInstagram\nTikTok\nSpotify\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "description": "Bun B and DMC stood shoulder-to-shoulder last year at the iconic West 4th Street basketball courts and other places in New York City. This was a celebration of Hip-Hop’s timeless spirit. Alongside producer and emcee Marco Polo, the two legends dropped a surprise collaboration –  a masterclass.\n\n“Bun DMC” is finally here. The track, created and produced byClipsmoke, tapped into the DNA of pure Hip-Hop and assembled a crew that cut across coasts, generations and styles. Polo, known for his dusty, soul-sample-driven production, also delivered bars on the track.\nThis turned into a mini block party with some of Hip-Hop’s most respected names. Queens lyricist Grafh came through, Massachusetts mainstay Termanology pulled up, and Staten Island’s Lil Dee brought youthful heat. AllHipHop’s Chuck Creekmur also made an appearance – look for him!\nCheck the video out for yourself and see who you recognize.

    "description": "Today marks a major milestone for rising artist Davontae, akaDrizzy Tae, as he drops his highly anticipated new albumNC-17.\n\nIt’s been a big week for the Arkansas native — he just turned 18 a few days ago, and now he’s stepping confidently into a new chapterwith a 10-track project that blends Pop and R&B sounds, a leap from his early days rooted in rap.\nTae wrote and recorded the majority ofNC-17at age 17, hence the name.\n“This album is really my first step into adulthood,” Tae says. And it shows — the record explores themes of first love, tour life, heartbreak, and self-belief, capturing the raw emotion and transition of being 17 in today’s America.\nDrizzy Tae has been at it since he was just 9 years old, making noise with rap singles like the fan-favorite “Heart Closed” with Luh Kel, and “Rock Star” with Lil Zay Osama.\nBut his sound began to shift after working with platinum producer Travis Marsh, who encouraged him to lean into the smooth, emotional soundscape of R&B — the genre Tae always quietly loved.\n“One cool full circle moment is that one performer I looked up to as a kid was 2kBaby — and he’s actually on this album!” Tae shares. That collaboration comes in the form of the track “Softest Woman.”\n“Basically, this shows me that if you continue to believe in yourself, any of your dreams can come true.” He adds, “I want to thank all the people who have been on this road with me. I’m so thankful for the fans who lifted me up when I was down. This album is for all of you.”\nSo, what’s next?\n“I’m about to drop the music video for ‘Rock Star’ with Lil Zay Osama — we shot it last time I was in L.A.,” he says.\nAnother full-circle, dream-come-true moment for Tae — and just the beginning of what’s shaping up to be a huge year for this talented young artist.\nNC-17is streaming now on all platforms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "title": "Holy Bars & War Cries: Caleb Gordon’s Tactical Gospel",
    "description": "Caleb Gordon’s “War” is the kind of album that doesn’t just knock; it kicks, preaches, and then politely asks if you’ve got spiritual armor on. It’s 14 tracks of holy fire and trap finesse, where theology meets street-level urgency and the beats slap hard enough to make your convictions rattle and vibrate to a whole new frequency.\n\nCaleb remains a fully independent artist, building his platform without major label backing, relying solely on faith, grit, and a mic. Earlier this year, he made history as the first Christian rapper to ever perform at Rolling Loud, a milestone that shows it’s not just catchy; it’s convincing.\nLet’s start with the title track, “War,” a reggae-infused banger that opens like a call to arms. “It’s a war in the city, it’s a war outside/Lucy spread lies, it’s a war in the mind,” he raps, laying out the battlefield not in some abstract metaphor but in the very real terrain of mental, cultural, and spiritual conflict. The production is lean and mean, no fluff, just a pulsing beat and Caleb’s voice cutting through like a prophet with a mixtape.\n<iframe style=”border-radius:12px” src=”https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/3hPlEX0M46IoVV1PxyIfnS?utm_source=generator” width=”100%” height=”352″ frameBorder=”0″ allowfullscreen=”” allow=”autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture” loading=”lazy”></iframe>\nThen there’s “Guard My Heart,” which feels like a journal entry written in the margins of Proverbs. Caleb’s flow is introspective but never soft; he’s pleading for protection, not from haters or critics, but from himself. The hook is simple, almost childlike, which makes the message hit harder. It’s the kind of track that makes you want to check your spiritual pulse.\n“Seat at the Table” flips the narrative a bit on its head. It’s not about exclusion; it’s about divine invitation. Caleb raps like someone who’s been told “no” too many times and finally heard “yes” from the only voice that matters. The beat is warm, the delivery confident, and the message clear: you don’t need to beg for a place in the world when God’s already set one for you. And then there’s “You Can’t Cancel Me,” which is less a song and more a theological mic drop. Caleb aims to cancel culture with scripture in one hand and swagger in the other. It’s bold, maybe even brash, but never reckless.\nThe album closes with “Upside Down,” which feels like a blessing wrapped in bass. It’s reflective, almost melancholy, as Caleb wrestles with the paradoxes of faith, strength in weakness, victory in surrender, and clarity in chaos. It’s the perfect ending to an album that never pretends the war is easy, only that it’s both necessary and worth fighting.\nHis high-energy performances have lit up stages at major Christian festivals like Rock the Universe, where he brings the same spiritual fire live as he does in the booth. He even caught the attention of NBA champion Dwight Howard, whose viral shoutout amplified his message beyond just music circles.\n“War” is a spiritual survival guide disguised as a playlist. Caleb Gordon’s flow is tight, his theology sharper than most seminary syllabi, and his conviction? Unshakable. With millions of streams and a rapidly growing fan base, Caleb’s reach continues to expand, proof that truth-driven music still moves people. If you’re looking for something that hits hard and prays harder, this is it.Connect with Caleb Gordon:Instagram,TikTok,YouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "title": "Clipse Drops First Album in 16 Years – Here’s Why It’s a Game-Changer",
    "description": "Clipseis back and the impact is seismic.\n\nThis isn’t just a nostalgic return or a reunion for the sake of headlines. Nah. This is ameteor strikein a rap landscape that’s been, frankly, coasting. Pusha T and No Malice, two certified veterans from Virginia Beach, just re-entered the arena withLet God Sort Em Out, and they’re landing to the body, head and, at times, below the belt.\nIn a time whenalgorithms, social media antics, and microwave music dominate the mainstream, Clipse offers something rare: intention. It’s mature. It’s cold. It’s calculating. It’sContemporary Adult Dope Boy Rap—a genre I’m stamping right now. Nobody’s truly mastered what aging gracefully looks like for the street-savvy emcee. We have seen it only for titans like JAY-Z to ghost the culture. Clipse did that which was as elusive as an electric eel covered in oil. They created a sonic lane that merges wisdom, war stories and wit without sounding preachy or washed. Or overly hard. These are grown men rapping at the highest level. Two artists, almost 50 and over 50, out-rapping entire generations.\nThis isn’t a review. But I have to briefly talk about “Birds Don’t Sing,” a standout track featuring John Legend and Voices of Fire. It’s soul-shaking. Deep. Emotive. It centers on their parents and the painful beauty of loss, legacy and reflection. In a genre where parents are often missing, condemned or spiritually benign, this song brings the pain to the forefront. It punched me in the chest. I lost my father at a young age, and this song unearthed that grief all over again. A whiteBillboard reviewer dismissed it as one of the weaker tracks. Maybe he couldn’t hear the frequency Clipse was operating on. I stopped reading his words immediately. Cultural resonance can’t be measured by metrics. Some things are meant to befelt, not explained. Sometimes the you have to come from the soil to get the soul.\nThe brilliance of Clipse is in their duality. Pusha is the brand keeper, the risk-taker, the wildcard who’s been navigating luxury rap and corporate chessboards. Malice—formerly No Malice—took a spiritual path, all the way to being a preacher. But on this album, he returns with a vengeance. Many are saying he out-rapped Push. And guess what? That’s fine. This isn’t sibling rivalry. It’s sibling supremacy. I love it.\nWe’ve seen countless rappers attempt comebacks after long hiatuses, chock-full of gymnastics. Most don’t stick the landing. Clipse could not fall off because they managed to create demand though absence. They have Pharrell and others, as well. The supporting cast of Ab Liva, Tyler, The Creator, Nas, Kendrick Lamar and others are all amazing onLet God Sort Em Out. Clipse hovered just under outer space and just above the clouds. Never predictable, but omniscient. OutKast should take note. I’m just saying.\nNow, let’s talk culture. We’ve continually made the mistake of measuring success by first-week numbers and playlist placements. Oh, and do not get me started on those that exist outside of our villages. Clipse didn’t come to play that game. F that. This isn’t aboutunits. This is aboutimpact. The community is talking. Quoting lines. Debating verses. And recognizing that something real has happened.\nThis album isn’t about the past. It’s about setting a path forward. To me, this is a roadmap for artists aging in Hip-Hop, for Black men reclaiming vulnerability. The culture must learn to balance growth with grit.Let God Sort Em Outproves you can evolve and still remain raw. It’s strategy. It’s elegance. And yes, it’s a little bit petty. Because Hip-Hop is going to maintains that sharp edge. The grown folks who tried to make “mature rap” a thing often forgot that some ingredients is part of the culture’s DNA. Clipse didn’t.\nAnd that brings me to the bigger picture. Clipse has created a blueprint. It is not the only one, but for rappers of a certain ethos, this can help. They’ve shown us what longevity looks like with purpose. They’ve redefined what it means to be an elder statesman in a genre obsessed with youth. Whether the rest of the industry follows their lead is anyone’s guess. But know: This is what cooking looks and feels like. That microwave sh#t gotta go.\nYou’ve been told. You’ve been informed. And yes: you’ve been warned.Now…Let God Sort Em Out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "title": "Juneteenth Reflections On Unity, Trust & Pure Black Love",
    "description": "“Well, it seems to be a cycle. We were freed, we gained some things. Then we had the area of turmoil with Dr. King and wanting more things. We will gain some things, but then we’ve got the police brutality, the KKK, the all the really rough things that have come again. And this thing is making us realize that we are all in the same boat.”–Dr. Opal Lee, The Mother Of Juneteenth\n\nThe other day, I did something different. I went for a run…in the rain…on purpose.\nNow, I’m not usually the type to romanticize running in “bad weather.” Sometimes I do it just to test my mettle, but recently I have not been on that type of time. In this instance, it was about testing something I believed in.\nI had just bought a hoodie fromActively Black, a brand I’d been watching for a while. They don’t just make clothes, they represent us in my view. I’d seen the work they do outside of apparel, empowering Black communities,amplifying Black voicesand putting real meaning behind Black-owned. The hoodie wasn’t cheap like my others ones either. But when it came in the mail, I felt like I got exactly what I paid for. It was top quality.\nSo I laced up, threw on the hoodie and hit the street for a three-mile run in the pouring rain. The hoodie held up, but something even more powerful happened halfway through.\nAs I ran, I encountered a young kid, a young African-American boy. I’d guess he was about 12 or 13. He signaled to me. I had my headphones in, so I couldn’t hear what he said. He held up a small sign I couldn’t make out. It was almost like he had yellow writing on white paper. I stopped, pulled my earbuds out to speak to him.\nHe looked at me smiling innocently and said,“Do you want a water?”Now, I don’t run with money. So I told him I didn’t have anything on me. If I had it, I would have supported. His response?\n“It’s all good. Take it anyway.”\nThat hit me. Hard.\nHere I was, out here running in a hoodie made by aBlack-owned companythat I intentionally supported, and this young Black boy was out here supporting me in this run. Honestly, I’m not certain he was even selling water. He might have been giving them away to people as they walked by.\nIt stopped me in my tracks and my brain started scrambling inside my skull. That one small moment felt like what Juneteenth is supposed to mean.\nIt’s not just about honoring our ancestors or marking the day the Black people in Galveston, Texas found out slavery had ended (two-and-a-half years after it was declared illegal). It’s also about how we treat each other and support each otherright now.It’s about what we do with our freedom. It’s about creating a culture where we uplift, support and look out for one another.\nI told the kid I’d come back after my run and give him some money for his water. Little did he know, I was about to give him some real money. After I finished running, I went straight to the ATM. But when I drove back, he was gone. And I was a little upset about that. I really wanted to bless him for being such a good kid. Not just because he gave me water. This kid gave me hope. Real talk.\nThen my mind started spiraling. What if he got scared I was coming back with bad intentions? What if his parents pulled him in? What ifIcouldn’t even fully trust the water at first? We’re so used to bracing for the worst, having no trust in each other that sometimes we can fall into a cultural spiral.\nThat exchange was pure. He helped me. I was wearing a hoodie that represented us. And I was out there trying to do better, train harder and level up.\nFreedom without unity is hollow and largely superficial.\nOn this Juneteenth, we have to remember that our power isn’t just in our past. It’s in how we move forward. How we treat each other. How we build each other up, even in the little things. Especially in the little things. Smile. Say “Hi.” Or give water.\nSupport each other. Trust each other. Look out for one another.\nThat’s the real celebration.\nEpilogue: Much love and respect to Dr. Opal Lee for pushing Juneteenth into being a federal holiday.\n\n\n\n\n",

    "title": "Op-Ed: What Philly’s Fan Expo Taught Me About Morality, Fandom & America",
    "description": "I hit upFan Expo in Philadelphia—formerly known as Wizard World—with some friends about a month ago. We were looking for a good time. Chill vibes. No stress; a chance to geek out at one of our favorite pastimes: comic book conventions. Except, like most things in America, it ended up being about more than just costumes, collectibles and cosplay.\n\nFan Expo is more than a comic book event. It’s a full-on pop culture celebration, an amazing sight to behold. We’re talking Star Wars, Marvel, DC, gaming, anime, fantasy, action figures and, of course, celebrity photo ops and autograph sessions. But once I got in the building and started doing my media rounds, it didn’t take long for something to start bothering me.\nWhen I got to the area for autographs, I was disturbed.\nMel Gibson had thelongestline in the building. Next to him was the saintly Danny Glover. Gibson, a guy I once admired, has a well-documented history of racism, misogyny, antisemitism and abuse. And he had a line of fans wrapped around the proverbial block. People paid upwards of $300 for photos and autographs. Meanwhile, incredible actors of color like Danny Glover,Giancarlo Espositoand John Boyega had lines so short you could’ve walked right up and said hello with no wait.\nAnd that’s exactly what I did with Giancarlo Esposito. No line. No crowd. Just me, face-to-face with a legend who’s been inDo the Right Thing,Breaking Bad,The Mandalorianand several other classics. His legacy is long, brilliant and full of purpose. Right next to Esposito was theDeadpooldog, who had a mob of fans vying for a picture and maybe even an autograph.\nA dog got more love than Giancarlo Esposito. Not from me though.\nI try not to knock people’s nostalgia. Mel Gibsonisa cinematic icon to many.Mad Max.Braveheart.Lethal Weapon. Sure, the résumé is long— but so is his rap sheet. This is a man who told the mother of his child she would be “raped by a pack of n*****s” (The Guardian, 2010). A man who’s made hateful, violent remarks against women, Black people, Jews and the LGBTQ+ community. He was even stripped of his right to bear arms at one point. And now, here he is welcomed, celebrated and adored by fans who seemingly see no conflict between his hate and their hero worship.\nThat disconnect is the real issue. In comic book and fantasy culture, the entire foundation is based on the battle between good and evil. Heroes fight for justice. Villains get their comeuppance. We root for the underdog, the righteous, the brave. And yet, here in the real world, people lined up to support the villain.\nGiancarlo Esposito? John Boyega? And Danny Glover, for goodness sake…these menarethe good guys. Not just in films, but in life.Boyega spoke out boldly during the George Floyd protests, risking his career to stand up for justice. Esposito has played morally complex characters, yes—but in person, he’s the real deal. His energy is pure. His presence is inspiring. He’s never once been on the wrong side of history, in fantasy or reality. And justgoogle Danny Gloverand his efforts to make the world a better place.\nSo why were their lines short?\nThe answer might be uglier than we want to admit. Celebrity worship in this country doesn’t require a moral compass. It just requires a memorable face and a few blockbuster roles. Redemption arcs are gold. In fact, they are given out freely—especially if you’re white, male and rich. Meanwhile, principled people of color are often undervalued, overlooked and, yes, under-booked. Look at the numbers, salaries and opportunities.\nThis isn’t just a Fan Expo problem. Fan Expo was great and one of the better cons. This is an America problem.\nWe’ve seen the same thing happen in Hip-Hop. The culture, born from struggle and built on values of resistance, creativity and truth, has often been diluted by those who enter it without respecting its roots. The core gets forgotten. The message gets lost. And too often, the villains become the headliners.\nThat first day, I decided not to do any official press work. I was truly shaken up and discouraged. I had to take a step back and reflect. What does it say about us when Gibson embodies everything we claim to fight against yet has the longest line? When the man who playedMoff GideoninThe Mandalorianwatches fans line up for a dog?\nIt made me question whether we actuallymeanwhat we say when we claim to support the good guys, the heroes. Does profound morality really matter to the masses or does only matter in fiction?\nEventually, I did spend money, something I don’t normally do. I bought a photo with Giancarlo Esposito. Not because I needed it, but because Ibelievedin it. I have red carpet pictures with him already. But I wanted to put my money where my mouth was. And I’m proud of that photo, not just because of who’s in it, but because of what it represents: support.\nTo those who got a photo with Mel Gibson: congrats. You paid top dollar for a memory with a man who has, time and time again, proven to be theoppositeof a hero.\nAs for me, I’ll still attend these conventions. Overall, Fan Expo was spectacular. On Sunday, the last day, I interviewed and talked to many people. Some interactions were like a family reunion of people I love and others were new, fresh relationships. I’ll still find joy in fantasy and storytelling. I’ll never let anybody steal that. But I’ll walk in a little more clear-eyed. A little more thoughtful. And a lot more intentional about who I choose to support—onscreen and off.\nBecause in a world where people still can’t tell the villain from the hero, I know which side I’m on.\nChuck Creekmur is the co-founder ofAllHipHop.com, a cultural commentator, media entrepreneur and lifelong comic book fan.The Hulk is his still his favorite.\nA post shared by Chuck Jigsaw Creekmur (@chuckcreekmur)\n\n\n\n\n",

    "title": "Memorial Day Was Black-Led Celebration Of Freedom That Racism Tried To Erase",
    "description": "Charleston’s Forgotten Memorial Day Roots Were Planted by Black Hands Honoring the Union Dead\n\nMemorial Day might look like backyard barbecues and flag-draped parades now, but its earliest roots trace back to the ruins of the Civil War. And it all started with newly freed Black people who insisted the Union’s fallen be appropriately honored.\nOn May 1, 1865, just weeks after the Civil War ended, about 10,000 Black residents of Charleston, South Carolina, gathered at a former Confederate racetrack.\nAt this location, hundreds of Union soldiers had died and been buried in unmarked graves. The site had been a prison camp during the war. Over 257 Union troops, most succumbing to disease, were dumped into shallow pits behind the track.\nInstead of letting those soldiers tumble into obscurity, a group of roughly two dozen Black people stepped in to ensure they were remembered. Believe it or not, they exhumed the bodies, laid them in organized rows and built a 10-foot-high white fence. The arch read “Martyrs of the Race Course” in black paint.\nThe tribute was no quiet affair.\nIt began with 3,000 Black schoolchildren marching around the graves with flowers, singing “John Brown’s Body.” Behind them came Black women and men representing various societies, pastors preaching sermons and about 30 speakers. It was organized by James Redpath, the Scottish immigrant, journalist andanti-slavery activist. Union regiments, both white and African Americans, drilled and paraded around the freshly laid graves. The entire day was filled with song, prayer and remembrance.\nTheCharleston Daily Courierand theNew York Tribunereported on the event. The graves looked like “one mass of flowers,” per theCourier. TheTribunecalled it “a procession of friends and mourners as South Carolina and the United States never saw before.”\nAfter finding a Tribune article in a Harvard archive, Pulitzer Prize-winning historian David Blight uncovered this largely forgotten story in 1996. His book,Race and Reunion: The Civil War in American Memory, argues that this Memorial Day predecessor was buried—pun intended—because it didn’t fit the narrative white historians wanted to tell.\nIn the decades after, Southern organizations like the United Daughters of the Confederacy and other racist groups denied knowledge of the event or shifted credit to white figures like Redpath. A 1937 book falsely claimed the ceremony occurred on May 30, the day General John A. Logan later designated as the official date for what would become Memorial Day in 1868.\nEventually, the Charleston racecourse was renamed Hampton Park after Confederate General Wade Hampton and the graves were moved to Beaufort National Cemetery. The memory of the Black organizers was all but erased.\nBut the truth still stands and will continue to be repeated. Before the government declared a national holiday and before white veterans made it official, Black Americans in Charleston created the first large-scale tribute to dead soldiers. They understood that freedom wasn’t free and simply wanted to thank them.\nThat Memorial Day story didn’t just honor the dead. It foreshadowed the centuries-long battle for recognition in the midst of racist erasure. This continues today.\nA post shared by Something Black Made® (@somethingblackmade)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "title": "Remembering Sacha Jenkins: Visionary In Hip-Hop & Counter In Culture",
    "description": "Chuck “Jigsaw” Creekmur talks about one of his heroes in creativity, the incomparable Sacha Jenkins.\n\nA few years ago, I had the privilege and honor to sit on a panel with the ubiquitous creative Sacha Jenkins. For me, it was more than a speaking engagement, it was a moment of validation. I had followed his work for years, decades actually. Sacha, the co-founder of the legendaryEgo Tripmagazine, represented a curvy, creative lane I deeply admired. To share space with someone who helped shape the very culture I coveted felt like an arriving. It should be noted, this was a few short years ago.\nNow, did I arrive in the same way he did? Not quite. But I felt accomplished. Proud. And though I never got to know Sacha Jenkins deeply on a personal level, I knew his work inside and out. Like myself, he had a wildly diverse creative palette. That versatility made me feel seen.\nI own hisMerciless Book of Metal Lists. I havePiecebook: The Secret Drawings of Graffiti Writers. And of course, theEgo Tripbooks are on my shelf, staples in any Hip-Hop culturalist’s library. He stood alongside peers like Kevin Powell and dream hampton, journalists who transcended the byline to become cultural architects. And in Sacha’s case, that rebellious spirit was never far from the surface. In my early days they all inspired me to get serious about creating.\nThat led to my work with Grouchy Greg in buildingAllHipHop.When I came on board, I brought my own lens. I had a distinct focus on lifestyle, drawn from my prior online publication dedicated to the “lifestyles of aggressive people.”Ego Tripwas the “The Arrogant Voice of Musical Truth.” That raw, unfiltered energy poured intoAllHipHop. I studied the game. I studied the greats. And Sacha Jenkins was one of them.\nUnder Sacha’s editorial vision,Ego Tripwas more than a magazine. It was an audacious, genre-smashing blueprint. Quirky, defiant and often absurd, it offered a version of Hip-Hop mediam where there were no rules. It wasn’t always polished, but it was alwaystrue. For those of us building Hip-Hop platforms outside the mainstream,Ego Tripwas just as influential as legacy titles likeThe SourceorXXL. It proved you could build culture without permission.\nJenkins’ creative journey didn’t stop there. He co-createdEgo Trip’sThe (White) Rapper Showon VH1, eventually becoming creative director at the revitalized Mass Appeal. He directed classic documentaries likeWu-Tang Clan: Of Mics and Men,Louis Armstrong’s Black & Blues,You’re Watching Video Music BoxandproducedSupreme Teamwith Nas.\nEven when critics pannedEverything’s Gonna Be All White—Showtime’s lowest-rated doc at the time—Jenkins stood firm. By the way, I was featured in that docu-series with a motley crew of truth-tellers and it was dope. He told hard truths, even if it made people uncomfortable. Haters gonna hate. So what.\nWhat makes Sacha Jenkins important isn’t just his talent. It’s his willingness to evolve, to challenge the system, while advancing the culture within said system. In an era where many creators chase viral clicks or placate platforms, Sacha choseauthenticityevery time. He reminded us that Hip-Hop is not just music. By the way, he was never just Hip-Hop. When he texted me his punk rock band, I knew he knew we were like minds, counter culture even within Hip-Hop.\nSacha Jenkins’ work was never about playing it safe. To me, it was about pushing the envelope until it was shredded and tattered. I appreciated when he left Mass Appeal. I don’t know why he left, but I was happy. We talked as the were creating the Rick James documentary, because I was the last to interview the great funk legend. I now realize, in looking at our texts, this guy was that guy. But not that guy dying for social or social media validation or that guy living for others. Like the lateGreg Tate, he was just that guyempirically.\nHis legacy is a torch passed to every journalist, filmmaker and creative who dares to speak truth without selling out. You can be radical, intelligent, hilarious and disruptive and still be respected. He showed us we, the non-rapping, yet rapping better than the rappers, creative as hell, intellectual in the streets and classroom artsy ass kids from everywhere are the culture too.\nRest in culture, Sacha Jenkins.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "title": "Jewish Community Reacts To Kanye West’s “Apology” For Antisemitic Rampage",
    "description": "Kanye Westhas been spouting antisemitic rhetoric since 2022, when he daftly proclaimed on Twitter (X) that he was about to go “death con 3 on Jewish people.” The backlash was swift, and he was immediately dropped by his agency CAA, production company MRC, adidas, Gap and Balenciaga.\n\nBut rather than repent, West doubled down and appeared onInfo Warsto proudly proclaim he’s a Nazi and gush about how much he loves Adolf Hitler. Three years later and West’s words and actions have left a wake of wreckage. But on Thursday (May 22), West tweeted out of nowhere that he was“done with antisemitism”and asked for forgiveness, claiming he was “sorry” for the pain he caused.\nThen less than an hour later, West promoted his latest song, “Heil Hitler.” Do the math.\nMost people aren’t buying his hallow apology, especially those in the Jewish community.\n“Words are cheap, what matters is action,” Alyssa Hochfelder, a fitness and nutrition coach based in Colorado, said. “Ye’s apology doesn’t erase the real world consequences of his antisemitic rhetoric. There were at least 59 documented antisemitic incidents directly citing his name.\n“This isn’t hypothetical harm lives were actually threatened and communities lived in fear. He didn’t just spew hate, he added fuel to an already rising fire of antisemitism. So until Ye puts in real, sustained work like education, reparations, and community his words don’t mean s###.”\nOf course, we’ve been here before. West has walked back his inflammatory comments before—and his words seem oddly familiar. In 2023, he wrote in Hebrew, “It was not my intention to offend or demean, and I deeply regret any pain I may have caused. I am committed to starting with myself and learning from this experience to ensure greater sensitivity and understanding in the future. Your forgiveness is important to me, and I am committed to making amends and promoting unity.”\n\nBut it wasn’t long before he was back at it. Jewish rapper Kosha Dillz isn’t convinced West meant a single word of his apology—now or back then.\n“Kanye is a product of our attention economy,” Kosha says. “He is experimenting with how desensitized we are to hatred. When Joe Rogan jokes about how catchy it is or how the Hip-Hop community says ‘Oh, he’s crazy’ or the Jewish community says ‘don’t talk about him,’ he wants that.\n“We are not necessarily avoiding Kanye; we are avoiding to the opportunity to learn about how the cancer of jew hatred—antisemitism—works in society and is consistently reinventing itself. It’s like, ‘If Kanye can bounce back and forth, why can’t everybody.’ But I don’t buy [West’s apology]. If we have an easy re-entry without consequence, anyone will do it.”\nThe American Jewish Committee (AJC) has been extremely vocal about its stance on Kanye West. Shortly after the release of “Heil Hitler,” AJC CEO Ted Deutch noted, “This is blatant antisemitism, and it’s disgusting. Ye is profiting off of Jew-hatred, and the music industry needs to step up and speak out against this obscenity.”\nThe AJC pointed out it was just West’s latest antisemitic outburst in 2025. On February 7, he posted things like “I’m a Nazi” and “Some of my best friends are Jewish and I don’t trust any of them,” alongside remarks targeting people with disabilities and other racial groups.\nJust days prior, West had run a Super Bowl ad in select markets directing viewers to his online store, which was found to be selling a $20 t-shirt emblazoned with a black s####### before being taken offline.\nIf Kanye West wants forgiveness, it’s going to be a long, arduous road for him to get it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

His image still appears on t-shirts and murals, but his ideology has been diluted, commercialized or marginalized. Hisuncompromising truthlives. We are in a moment where white nationalism is rising, truth is curated by algorithms and history—Black History—is being scrubbed from institutions.

We can call him one of the many precursors. His transformation in prison, the trials and tribulations and his ability to weaponize language without violence is very Hip-Hop. Rappers, particularly Gen X MCs, picked up the baton.\nBy the way, Nas and Malcolm X are reportedly related.\nIn Ilyasah Shabazz bookThe Awakening of Malcolm X: A Novel, she said, “To our cousin, the visionary multiplatinum recording artist Nasir bin Olu Dara Jones, akaNas.

That demand and fearlessness was infused into Hip-Hop’s DNA early on.\nIn the ’80s and early ’90s, groups like Public Enemy and Boogie Down Productions sampled his speeches and embodied his teachings. Chuck D once called Malcolm “the blueprint for the truth-teller in Hip-Hop.”\n“When we said ‘Fight the Power,’ that was straight from Malcolm,” Chuck D said inMalcolm X: Make It Plain. “He gave us that audacity.”\n“Like others before him, such asMalcolm X, it took time for them to evolve in[to] the men they would be. And I think 2Pac was actively making moves…[and]…evolving very rapidly to what I think he would have been,” I toldGood Morning Americanine years ago.\n2Pac was often compared to Brother Malcolm for his mix of street knowledge and revolutionary politics.\n“I’m not saying I’m going to change the world,” ‘Pac once said. “But I guarantee that I will spark the brain that will.” Well, Malcolm was that spark.\nFrom Revolutionary to Relic?But where is Malcolm’s voice now?\nToday, Hip-Hop’s radical roots seems to have shriveled up. Many of the mainstream artists are trapped in cycles of excess (drugs, liquor, social media), performative street nonsense or corporate-friendly lyrics. The rebel in rap has been defanged, which coincides with a broader trend.\nConservative movements rewriting or banning Black history in schools.Florida’s curriculum downplays slavery. Textbooks are being whitewashed. Radical Black voices—Fred Hampton, Assata Shakur, Angela Davis and Malcolm X—are being edited out. And worse, if they can turn Malcolm into a mascot, they can mute a movement.\nBut they can’t…Malcolm X’s early life is closer to modern thug rap than any Ivy League scholar. The criminal-turned-conscious archetypeisthe Malcolm story. His past as “Detroit Red” wasn’t glorified, but it was evidence of what a person could become.\nSome rap is apolitical. But, there are many artists are still carrying Malcolm’s fire. Kendrick Lamar’sTo Pimp A Butterflyis a modern-day message to the oppressed. J. Cole, Rapsody, Noname, Tef Poe and others continue the lineage of liberation.\nMalcolm spoke truth, and that’s all most rappers ever wanted to do.\nWhy We Need Malcolm NowMalcolm X is not just a figure from the past. He’s the unfinished project of Black liberation. His messages about media bias, the dangers of assimilation and self-determination are relevant in the age of AI disinformation and state-sanctioned violence.\nWhen Malcolm said,“The media’s the most powerful entity on Earth,”he was foreshadowing the social media algorithms that now control public perception.\nWhen he said,“If you’re not careful, the newspapers will have you hating the people who are being oppressed,”he was predicting Fox News, clickbait, and cancel culture.\nWhat about his message isn’t relevant today?\nThe Call To Action In Hip-Hop\nA post shared by Nipsey Hussle Tha Great (@ermiasthemessiah)\nHip-Hop, as a culture, must decide what it stands for as it zooms past 50. Does it remain a vessel for Black expression, youthful resistance and straight-up truth-telling or does it become another corporate tool for benign entertainment?\nRe-invoking Malcolm X isn’t about quoting him. We have to turn off the screen and channel him. The youth need an update, because Kodak Black isn’t getting it.\nIt’s about re-centering therebelspirit, not just the profitable plan. The algorithm is the new power.\nSo on this 100th birthday of el-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz, let’s make it plain:The Mission Continues.\n\n\n\n",

    "title": "Met Gala’s Theme Was Tailoring Black Style—So Why Did The Red Carpet Look So Basic?",
    "description": "When I first heard the2025 Met Gala theme—“Superfine: Tailoring Black Style”—paired with the dress code “Tailored for You,” I was genuinely excited.\n\nIt felt like the perfect moment to honor the legacy, artistry and cultural weight of Black style. I expected bold, personal interpretations: custom cuts, rich fabrics and nods to historical silhouettes all infused with cultural meaning.\nBut as the looks rolled out, that excitement quickly faded. Too many attendees played it safe or missed the theme entirely, offering up generic red carpet glam instead of engaging with such a rich and specific concept.\nThe theme celebrated the legacy of Black dandyism and the way Black individuals have historically used tailored fashion as self-expression, resistance, and cultural identity. Inspired by Monica L. Miller’sSlaves to Fashion, the accompanying exhibition traced Black style from the 18th century to today, spotlighting its global impact on fashion history.\nThat said, some of my favorite looks came from those who fully embraced the theme in creative and unexpected ways.\nA post shared by Jimmy Neutch (@teyanataylor)\nAlton Masonand Teyana Taylor were standouts.Alton wore custom BOSS inspired byJoJo’s Bizarre Adventure—one of my favorite animes—channeling Giorno Giovanna’s signature style with an Afro-futuristic twist and a silver eye patch that paid homage to Slick Rick. Shaboozey also nailed it in custom Robert Wun, with turquoise grills, a beaded outfit, a slanted hat, and a cropped jacket that brought a fresh, expressive energy to the carpet.\nAmong the women, Teyana Taylor, Jodie Turner-Smith, Nicki Minaj and Janelle Monáe completely stole the show.\nUnfortunately, not everyone brought the same level of imagination.\nZendaya—usually a Met Gala icon—showed up in custom white Louis Vuitton by Pharrell. It wasn’t a bad look, but it felt surprisingly safe from someone known for ethereal, show-stopping moments. This time, she seemed to be coasting rather than commanding the carpet.\nMegan Thee Stallion’s Michael Kors ensemble, a white faux fox opera coat and high-slit dress, gave off senior prom vibes. Her hair was the best part, but overall, the look didn’t land for me.\nSome attendees completely missed the theme:\nGiven how deeply Black culture and fashion were at the heart of this year’s theme, it was disappointing to see so many non-Black attendees avoid taking risks. Whether due to fear of critique or a lack of cultural understanding, the result was a red carpet that too often fell flat. For a night meant to celebrate Black style in all its tailored brilliance, the missed opportunities were loud—and so was the silence from those who didn’t even try.\nDespite the lack of creativity from many attendees, I genuinely appreciated the theme itself.\n“Superfine: Tailoring Black Style” offered a rich, nuanced lens through which to explore fashion, culture, and history. And for those who leaned into it, the results were both memorable and meaningful.\nWhile not everyone rose to the occasion, the theme sparked important conversations and celebrated a legacy that deserved the spotlight. I hope future Met Galas continue to embrace concepts this bold and rooted in cultural significance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "title": "Beyoncé Just Changed Country Music’s Rules",
    "description": "When Beyoncé kicked off the COWBOY CARTER TOUR in Los Angeles on April 28, it felt like more than just the start of a show. Much likeTHE RENAISSANCE TOUR, it marked the beginning of something bigger, a cultural movement. Through this next chapter in her three-act saga, Beyoncé continues her mission to redefine genre, reclaim space, and shine a light on stories that have long been erased from American music history.\n\nWithCowboy Carter, she centers Black voices in country music while still carrying the energy and legacy ofRenaissance, which celebrated Black queer artistry and ballroom culture. Dressed in all-white Western looks styled through a distinctly Black lens, Beyoncé steps onto the stage and immediately challenges the traditional image of country music — and who it’s meant for.\nThis isn’t a departure fromRenaissancebut a continuation. She weaves in tracks like “I’m That Girl,” “Cozy” and “Alien Superstar” to remind us that the journey she’s on is about reclaiming genres that Black artists helped create. These songs help connect the dots between the two acts, showing how ballroom and country actually share deep roots in Black expression.\nWhat Beyoncé is doing on this tour isn’t just about art. It’s a form of cultural storytelling. It’s about healing, resistance, joy, and visibility. She’s creating a space that challenges how both country music and ballroom culture have been cleaned up and watered down in the mainstream. And she’s bringing them together in a way that feels both radical and deeply familiar.\nThere are meaningful details throughout the show like cowboy-themed statues in the interludes and her grand entrance on a golden horse. In Beyoncé’s world, line dancing and voguing exist side by side. She builds a bridge between Black rural tradition and queer urban rebellion, two communities that have often been overlooked or pushed to the margins.\nHer dancers, many of whom come from the ballroom scene, vogue, duckwalk, and even Riverdance across the stage. It turns these country music venues into ballrooms filled with joy and celebration. It’s a powerful reminder that queer Black joy has always been here even if it hasn’t always been welcomed.\nAs the story continues to unfold, Beyoncé shows us that the field and the ballroom were never that far apart. And now, with her spotlight, they’re both being seen like never before.\nAct II is here — and it’s arriving with boots on the ground and bass in the trunk.\nTheRenaissanceisn’t over. It’s just evolving, through the eyes and vision of Beyoncé Giselle Knowles-Carter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "title": "Does Trump Want To Pay White People $5,000 To Have Babies?",
    "description": "The Donald is Wildin’!\n\nDonald Trump wants babies. He wants babies for Americans. How is this even possible? Well, word on the street is that he’s prepared to startpaying families $5,000 to have babies. As you know, fewer and fewer people are getting married — and even fewer are having children. What a conundrum when you’re trying to grow the economywith people. But I digress.\nLet’s break this down a little bit.\nAs Americans are hit harder with economic hardships, this idea pops up. I’m not sure how it makes sense — but I think I know what’s going on.First of all, let’s get the elephant front and center: statistically speaking, America is on track to become browner than ever before. In fact, Latino folks are now the largest minority group, reproducing even more than Black people. On top of that, white people are reproducing less than ever. For a white supremacist, this is a nightmare. They might as well start wearing hats that say “Make America White Again.” The only problem is, America was never a white-only country.\nAs I see it, some people will be dumb enough to have babies based on a $5,000 incentive. Why? Because they think they can get that money and run — not even thinking about how much babies and kidsreallycost! Sure, some may see it as a helpful incentive to get their family started. But if you’re like me, thinking about college, sports fees, and all the books and supplies kids need, you’re gonna pause and reflect.\nNow there’s even more to this than I’m saying. Have you seen the movieIdiocracy? It’s a dystopian comedy that paints a bleak vision of the future. In one scene, an educated couple debates having kids and ultimately decides it’s never the right time because the world isn’t perfect. Meanwhile, a very dumb couple just keeps popping out babies with no thought at all. Eventually, they outnumber the intelligent folks. Why? Because they justdo itwithout thinking.\nI think that’s what Donald Trump is trying to do. He wants to encourage the less educated to have more kids. They’re easier to influence, easier to control, and they fuel the economy without challenging the system. A nation of idiots? That’s what he wants, in my opinion.\nTo be fair, other countrieshavelaunched similar programs. In fact, I think he stole it fromMuammar Gaddafi,who gave Libyan women $5,000 (US dollars equivalent) for herself and the newborn. But this Trump thing just feels… different. Do you really think Donald Trump wants more Black babies and Latino babies? I don’t. He runs on a platform ofnationalismand it sure doesn’t feel like this energy is directed toward anyone with melanin in their skin.\nCheck this out, because, race aside, the math isn’t mathing.\nWhat do you think?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "title": "Cory Booker, Hakeem Jeffries And Persist Network Fight For Justice On Capitol Hill Using John Lewis’ Spirit",
    "description": "Georgetown University ProfessorDr. Nola HaynesDiscusses What Was Accomplished On The Steps Of The Capitol Over The Weekend.\n\nYesterday, I had the profound honor of speaking on the steps of Capitol Hill during a powerful sit-in organized to honor the legacy of the late John Lewis and to commemorate his own courageous sit-in in 2017.\nAlongside Senator Cory Booker and Representative Hakeem Jeffries, we gathered not just as politicians, but as advocates for justice, unity, and the enduring power of grassroots activism. The theme of our demonstration—“Good Trouble”—was a phrase that resonated deeply throughout the day, reflecting John Lewis’ unwavering commitment to fighting for the rights of all Americans.\nThis sit-in was not merely a performative act; justice is not performative. The sit-in was steeped in the rich traditions of faith and social justice, principles that John Lewis championed throughout his life. I was present as a representative of thePersist Network, a woman-led rapid response organization formerly known as Women for Harris. This powerful coalition was founded by the inspiringRhonda Foxxand I stood among leaders who share a collective vision for a more equitable future. Our gathering was a reminder that activism is rooted in community and that voices from all walks of life matter.\nAs the sit-in progressed, we were joined by a diverse array of speakers, including Senators Adam Schiff, Raphael Warnock, and Angela Alsobrooks, along with Representatives Maxwell Frost and Sydney Kamlager-Dove. Each voice added to the rich tapestry of our collective struggle, underscoring the urgency of our cause. We were also honored to hear from the Little Lobbyists and Santiago Mayer, theGen-Z founder of Voters of Tomorrow, emphasizing the importance of engaging young people in the political process.\nA post shared by Dr. Nola Haynes (@nolahaynes)\nThe event was an interfaith celebration, with faith leaders from Christian, Muslim, and Jewish communities coming together to speak and sing. This diversity of belief was a powerful testament to our shared values of compassion, justice, and solidarity. As we united in song and prayer, the spirit of hope and resilience filled the air, reinforcing the notion that we are stronger together.\nOur sit-in aimed to challenge the House Budget proposal that would impose devastating cuts to Medicaid, a program vital for the health coverage of 72 million Americans, and to food assistance programs that help feed families in need. President Trump had promised to protect American families, yet this budget starkly betrays that commitment while simultaneously offering tax breaks to the wealthiest. These issues are not abstract; they are everyday kitchen table concerns that affect millions of Americans, and we cannot stand idly by as the most vulnerable among us are left to suffer.\nSenator Bookerand Representative Jeffries demonstrated remarkable resolve, sitting on the steps for twelve hours, beginning their vigil as a duo and drawing attention to the plight of working-class constituencies. I had the privilege of documenting this significant moment for seven hours before speaking alongside them, as well as fellow Persist Network members Suzanne Lambert and Monique Pressley. We were later joined by Representative Jamie Raskin.\nIn honoring John Lewis, we reaffirmed our commitment to “Good Trouble” and the tireless pursuit of justice. This day will remain etched in my memory as a reminder of the power of collective action and the importance of standing firm in the face of injustice. As proof, over 6 million people tuned into the livestream and millions helped the sit-in go viral online. Together, we are a force for change, and together we will continue to fight for the rights and dignity of all.\nThis fight for the soul of democracy, equality, and decency is a moral fight, a theme that resonated throughout the day. Senator Booker is paving the way, charting a political legacy rooted in the moral philosophy of Good Trouble. He is fresh off his famous 25-hour filibuster-protest.\nWhatGood Troublewill you, as a reader, get involved in to ensure your family has the dignity to live freely without persecution and free from an increasing autocratic administration? The truth is, whether you like it or not, democracy is the only system on earth where Black people have a chance to advance. Authoritarianism is the opposite, and this is where the U.S. is heading, fast. Community, get into some Good Trouble. We can’t afford to sit this righteous fight out.\nOur ancestors did not, nor can we.\nDr. Nola Haynes is a professor atGeorgetown University.

    "title": "Did “Daredevil: Born Again” Flop Or Are There Racists Hating On “Progressive” Marvel?",
    "description": "First of all,Daredevil: Born Againwasamazing. The show, which recently had a grand finale, was a true treat to watch. Fans of the original series, a product of Netflix, felt sustained and satisfied.  But, now we have to deal with the reality of ratings.\n\nDaredevil and Disney+ could be biggest Marvel’s biggest misfire ever.  This is not rooted in the creative, but theNielsen. TheBorn Againreboot did not even crack the Nielsen ratings charts, according to recent reports. They chargenot one single episodehas made the ratings cut. Before we dig a bit deeper, let us compare and contrast.\nMeanwhile, Hulu’sGood American Family, a complete different platform, managed to clock 344 million minutes. Daredevil would’ve needed about 172 million minutes per episode. It didn’t even get close to the Nielsen Top 10.  Yikes.\nDisney+ automatically registers with Nielsen’s tracking systems, also an industry standard. Disney’s got inroads to Samba TV too, but those numbers have not come in forDaredevil: Born Again. There is still some serious hope.\nMarvel die-hards are out there and the critics are feeling that this isthee show. Could the rest of the city but jumping the bandwagon late? Not likely, based on traditional thought. Nielsen’s method accounts for total series views, so if Born Again had a binge momentum, we’d see it. Still there is hope!The overall Rotten Tomatoes ratings are through the roof.\nThere is already a Season 2 ofBorn Againannounced, which will continue to develop The Punisher, Ms. Marvel, Bullseye and other characters that began to emerge. And, be clear: they have already started shooting and they have already announced March 2026 has the date. I am here for it.\nKevin Feige, we got this!\nDisney+ may have a long range issue, and Season 2 ofDaredevilis probably part of the long range solution.Bluey— the Australian cartoon juggernaut – is great and all, but DD is the gift that keeps on giving.  We are not too concerned withMoana 2or whatever elsethey saywill save the platform.\nWhen Marvel rolled out Disney+ shows, Feige promised “movie-quality” MCU storytelling.Daredevil: Born Againis that good look that we’ve come to know and love about the franchise. Some wack jobs have tried to accuse the show of having an “agenda,” we the people say “GTFOHWTBS.” Was there an agenda when police officers adoptedthe Punisher logo to justify their brutality? The Disney double down is appreciated.\nHaters are gonna hate, racists are going to bait, but we’re going to move forward.\nUp next?Ironheart,Wonder Man, Thunderbolts and the much-hyped Fantastic Four reboot have us cautiously hopeful.Captain America: Brave New Worldspoke volumes at the box office. How will these others fare? We’ll soon see.\nMarvel has us drooling at the sight ofAvengers: Doomsday, but Daredevil and other shows maybe taking the heat for overall burnout. When that happens, sometimes you just have to sit still, ride it out until the AC kicks in.\nFor more, check out theCertified Squad on YouTube.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "title": "Playboi Carti Is Confusing & Chaotic But Lowkey Brilliant",
    "description": "After five long years of silence,Playboi Cartifinally dropped his latest album,MUSIC, on March 14—and, as expected, the internet erupted. Some fans praised its fearless experimentation, while others were left completely baffled. For me though, it felt like the natural evolution of an artist who’s always thrived on chaos and reinvention.\n\nMUSICis Carti at his most unpredictable. It’s expansive, erratic, sometimes flat-out confusing—but somehow, it still feels intentional. I’m not the biggest Carti fan by any means, but I’ve always been curious to see how his sound would evolve, especially afterWhole Lotta Red. That project leaned into a raw, vampiric aesthetic laced with punk and funk energy. While it didn’t completely land for me, it sparked enough intrigue to keep me watching.\nNow, I’ve always been partial to the earlier stuff—Playboi CartiandDie Lit—where his playful, experimental flow and minimalist beats felt exciting and new. Songs like “Foreign,” “R.I.P.,” “FlatBed Freestyle” and “Love Hurts” still get heavy rotation from me, way more than anything onWhole Lotta Red. So going intoMUSIC, I was curious: would Carti keep riding the voice-change wave he debuted on Travis Scott’s “FE!N”? I wasn’t into the track itself, but like everyone else, I was hypnotized by that bizarre new vocal tone. Once I realized it was Carti, I needed to know—was this a one-off, or was he fully leaning in?\nFrom “FE!N” to “Carnival” to “Timeless,” it became clear: this wasn’t a gimmick—it was a full-blown persona. And I was all in.\nWhen I hit play onMUSIC, I expected Carti’s signaturepunk-rage energy—but the opening track “POP OUT” still caught me off guard. That ear-splitting production and aggressive delivery? It felt like sonic whiplash. I won’t lie, I wasn’t feeling the first few tracks. It sounded like pure noise. But then “EVIL JORDAN” dropped, and everything shifted. The production smoothed out. Carti found a pocket that wasn’t just rage for rage’s sake—it had shape, focus, a weird kind of beauty.\nThat track became the turning point, the axis of the album. From there,MUSICunfolded into something more dynamic. And while I wish he had kept the original guitar-laced version of “EVIL JORDAN,” the final cut still works.\nSongs like “FINE SH*T,” “CHARGE DEM HOES A FEE” and “FOMDJ” kept me locked in. The production quality is wild, and Carti’s presence is undeniable. Love it or hate it, youfeelit.\nNow, a month after release, I can say it:MUSICholds up. In fact, it’s one of those albums that gets better the more you live with it. What felt abrasive at first now feels like deliberate experimentation. The voice switches, unpredictable flows, chaotic energy—they don’t feel like mood swings anymore. They feel like calculated risks from an artist creating in his own universe.\nCarti isn’t trying to topDie Litor replicateWhole Lotta Red. He’s not chasing hits. He’s building a world. And that, more than anything, is what makesMUSICspecial. He’s evolving, he’s fearless, and he’s not asking for permission.\nWhat makes this his best project to date?MUSIChas something for every Carti fan. If you’re into the vamped-out rage ofWLR, you’ll find tracks that hit like mosh-pit anthems. If you prefer the melodic bounce ofDie Lit, it’s in there too. Even fans of the self-titled debut will hear echoes of that playful, magnetic energy.MUSICis a full-circle moment—Carti in every form: vamp, baby voice, punk rock demon, avant-garde innovator.\nIt’s not always easy to digest. It’s jarring. It’s bold. It’s annoying at times. But that’s Carti. And whether you love every track or skip a few, there’s something in this project that’ll pull you back. Maybe it’s the production. Maybe it’s the ad-libs. Maybe it’s the feeling that you’re listening to something being built in real time.\nTop 3 album of 2025? I’m not ready to say that—yet.But let’s just say, it’s in the running. And that’s saying a lot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Featuring production from Kanye West, the song was a hit for the Queens-bred rapper.\nThe most recent collaboration marks the latest chapter in a decades-long relationship between the two artists. Consequence, a cousin of A Tribe Called Quest’s Q-Tip, first gained national attention in the late 1990s.\nHe later played a significant role in the development of West’s early solo career. He gave a standout verse on “Spaceship” from West’s 2004 debut albumThe College Dropout.\nOver the years, Consequence became a fixture in the Ye’s G.O.O.D. Music camp, vocals and songwriting to albumsLate RegistrationandGraduation. He is credited as a co-writer on several Kanye West tracks, including “Flashing Lights” and “Gone.”\nThe relationship soured in 2011 when Consequence left G.O.O.D. Music. He would go on to publicly criticized West and labelmate Pusha T. The two reconciled years later and resumed creative work on West’sDondaalbum.\nNow, Consequence is also focused on his teen son,Caiden the Crownholder, who is an accomplished rapper too. Caiden recently went viral on TikTok with a freestyle that garnered over 5 million views.\nNo release date has been announced for the new single, but Consequence said the track is part of a broader rollout planned for the summer.\n“I’ve never been one to kick my feet up,” he said. “It’s boots to the ground. Always has been.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "description": "Megan Thee Stallionis urging a federal judge in Florida to sanctionMilagro Gramzand grant her legal team direct access to Gramz’s social media accounts after repeated failures to comply with court orders in their ongoing defamation case.\n\nIn newly filed court documents, Megan’s attorneys allege that Gramz, whose legal name is Milagro Elizabeth Cooper, has ignored multiple requests to turn over documents and digital communications tied to the lawsuit.\nThe records were due by May 27, but Megan’s team says nothing has been produced.\nThe rapper’s legal team is asking the court to compel Gramz to immediately provide the requested materials and waive any objections she may have had to the discovery requests.\nThey also want a third-party forensic firm, FTI Consulting, to be granted access to Gramz’s accounts on platforms such as Instagram, WhatsApp, Discord, and iMessage to retrieve potentially deleted or hidden messages.\nIf that access is denied, Megan’s lawyers are asking the court to instruct the jury to assume that any missing messages would have been damaging to Gramz’s defense.\nThe filing also includes a request for sanctions, including attorney fees, due to what Megan’s team describes as Gramz’s “continued refusal to participate in discovery.”\nThey argue that her lack of cooperation is obstructing the case and creating unnecessary legal expenses.\nThis dispute is part of a larger defamation and harassment lawsuit Megan filed against Gramz in 2023.\nThe suit accuses Gramz of spreading false claims online about theTory Lanez shooting, including allegations that Megan lied under oath and distributed deepfake pornography.\nThe court previously ruled that Gramz’s statements were not protected as journalism or opinion, allowing the case to move forward. A gag order was also issued, barring Gramz from posting online about Megan.\nAfter her previous lawyers withdrew due to unpaid fees,Gramz recently hired two new attorneys—Jeremy McLymont and Ronda Dixon—to avoid a default judgment, according toAllHipHop.\nThe court has scheduled a hearing for July 14 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida to address the matter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The storyline that has had fans rooting for a crossover love story since last year.\n“Coco got me down,”Zeddyjoked, referencing past interview with the platform. “That was my crush, bro. But now I’m taking my talents… I mean, now I’m going to reality drama, bro. Yes. I need that in my life.”\nZeddy specifically stated he needed a “baddie” from theZeus Network.\nRespectful of Coco’s current relationship status, Zeddy made it clear he’s not pressing the issue. “She’s not married, but she’s like in a relationship, and I’m respectful.”\nCoco Jones is now dating NBA player Donovan Mitchell. The couple sparked dating rumors about a year ago before Jones confirmed their relationship on the Club Shay Shay podcast. And, yesterday she revealed she is now engaged to be married.\nA post shared by Coco Jones (@cocojones)\nZeddy’s crush materialized during a past AllHipHop conversation withChuck “Jigsaw” Creekmur.\n“Coco, I love you. She got the voice, she’s gorgeous, she stays out of drama. I love Coco for real,” he said a few short months ago. “I’m manifesting it. I’ll meet her on a red carpet.

    "title": "EXCLUSIVE: Cardi B Fights Back Against “GreasyFry” Producers, Says Their Copyright Lawsuit Is Bogus",
    "description": "Cardi Bis pushing to shut down a copyright lawsuit in Texas over her track “Enough (Miami),”arguing the plaintiffs never registered their song“Greasy Frybread”and can’t legally sue her in the state.\n\nThe Hip-Hop star and her record labels—Atlantic Recording Corp. and Warner Music Group—filed a motion to dismiss the case brought by Texas-based artists Sten Joddi and producer Kemikal956.\nJoddi (real name Joshua Frausto) and Kemikal956 (Miguel Aguilar) released “Greasy Frybread” in 2021. The song was featured in the FX television series Reservation Dogs.\nThe duo claims Cardi B’s 2024 single lifted elements from their composition, specifically the melody and bassline, but not the lyrics.\nBut according to Cardi B’s legal team, the entire case is legally flawed from the start.\n“It is black-letter law that a copyright registration is required to file a federal claim… The lack of a copyright registration therefore dooms these claims too because, as noted above, a registration is required before bringing any ‘civil action for infringement of the copyright in any United States work,'” attorney W. Andrew Pequignot wrote in the motion.\nThe plaintiffs originally filed a federal copyright claim, but since the work is not registered, that claim can’t move forward. They then attempted to pivot to a common-law copyright argument, which Cardi’s team claims is invalid because federal law supersedes state-level claims in these matters.\nThe lawsuit also includes claims of defamation, misappropriation, and unfair competition.\nHowever, Cardi B’s attorneys argue those are just different ways of saying the same thing: that she allegedly copied their music. Since all the claims are based on that core accusation, they say the entire case is preempted by federal copyright law.\nBeyond that, the Bronx rapper’s team argues that Texas courts shouldn’t be involved. Cardi B lives in New Jersey, and her labels are based in Delaware and New York.\nCardi B’s legal team also criticized the producers for repeatedly changing their claims and failing to present a consistent argument.\nThey asked the court to dismiss the case entirely and prevent any further amendments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "description": "T.I.lost a major legal battle in New York where a federal judge barred him and his company Grand Hustle Films from using the title “Situationships” for their upcoming movie after a trademark dispute with another production company.\n\nThe ruling came afterFeatherstone Entertainment, founded by Cylla Senii, sued the rapper’s company over the use of the word“Situationships,”which it trademarked in 2023. Featherstone has used the name since 2015 for a web series, book and screenplay focused on modern dating.\nAccording to court documents,T.I.and Grand Hustle Films moved forward with the project using the title in casting calls, interviews and production materials.\nThe company also attempted to register variations like “Battle of the Situationships” and “City of Situationships,” but the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office rejected at least one application due to its similarity to Featherstone’s registered mark.\n\nFeatherstone said it tried to resolve the issue privately. The company met with Grand Hustle Films multiple times and claims the studio agreed to change the name.\nBut despite those discussions, Grand Hustle kept filing new trademark applications using the word “Situationships.” After receiving no response to a cease-and-desist letter, Featherstone filed suit.\nThe judge sided with Featherstone, ruling the company is likely to succeed in its trademark claim and would suffer harm if Grand Hustle Films continued using the name. The court issued an injunction stopping T.I. and his team from producing, promoting or distributing any content using “Situationships” or similar terms.\nThe order also requires Grand Hustle Films to scrub the name from all promotional materials, websites and products. They must also preserve all documents related to the project.\nT.I. responded by saying the title was never finalized and has not used the mark SITUATIONSHIPS within the last several months.\nThe case remains active, but for now, Grand Hustle Films is legally blocked from using the disputed name while the lawsuit plays out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "title": "Arrested Development Dedicates “Adult Contemporary Hip Hop” Album To Twan Mack",
    "description": "Grammy Award-winning Hip-Hop groupArrested Developmentreleased its sixteenth studio album,Adult Contemporary Hip Hop, on Friday (July 4).\n\nThe 20-track project, dedicated to late Kali Tribe MC Twan Mack who died unexpectedly in November 2024, features guest verses from Ke’Andra, Bee Taylor, longtime collaborator Tasha LaRae and 1 Love as well as a posthumous verse from Twan.\n“Twan Mack was a genuine friend to me since high school and that alone is hard to come by as you get older and associates come and go,” Speech tellsAllHipHop. “But Mack was also a very genuine lover of Hip-Hop music. He had a pure and hungry heart to see Hip-Hop go in the most healthy and progressive directions.\n“He toured opening up for Arrested Development in Asia, Europe the UK and, of course, the U.S. His unexpected/sudden death took everybody that knew him by surprise. I couldn’t stop crying because of the loss. His biggest goal when he was alive was to get a new category for Hip Hop Artists that were over 35 years old and that was “adult contemporary Hip-Hop,” so I wanted to continue that tradition for him in his passing.”\nSpeech opens the album on a personal note with the song “Let’s Get On With It” in which he mentions Twan Mack’s death within the first bar. From there, he reflects on the young Speech, who struggled with a “lack of principles,” as he puts it, before diving into society’s consciousness being “minimal.”\nAs the title suggests, the album is chock-full of grown-man verses, a refreshing break from the often ignorant bars infiltrating mainstream rap.\n“I want Hip-Hop fans and Arrested Development fans in general tobe immersedin the hunger, musicality, skills and relevancy of this 37-year-old revolutionary collective from Atlanta, Georgia,” he adds. “I want people to be inspired to remember why we were so important to Hip-Hop in the first place and why we continue to be in 2025—and in fact, possibly more than ever including our debut.”\n\nTo coincide with the release, Arrested Development released a video for “Pack It Out.” The vibrant visual, shot in the desert, finds Speech and company spreading joy as they sail through their lyrics. In fact, Speech addresses the negativity that seems to dominate the headlines in 2025.\n“Fact after fact, from the tap new slaps for the floor seats,” Speech raps. “We come back to back with boom bap and the stats to fill the score sheets/And while I’m speaking on that, we zig zagged the whole map for our touring/AD may be the most positively sure thing/For the bucks that you forking up/We adorable/Trust us we a Oracle/Never sus cuz our aura is full/The opposite of deplorable.”\nArrested Development, formed in Atlanta in 1988, made a profound impact on Hip-Hop by offering a positive, Afrocentric alternative to the prevailing gangsta rap of the early ’90s. Their debut album,3 Years, 5 Months and 2 Days in the Life Of…, broke barriers by winning two Grammy Awards, including Best New Artist, a first for any Hip-Hop group.\nThey also sold millions of copies worldwide thanks to its monster singles, “Tennessee” and “Mr. Wendal,” which tackled racial injustice and homelessness. Arrested Development’s conscious lyrics and uplifting messages provided a new direction for Hip-Hop, emphasizing hope, social responsibilities and cultural pride at a time when the genre was dominated by darker themes.\nThe group’s influence extended into fashion and cultural representation by popularizing African-inspired clothing and celebrating Southern Black culture. Simultaneously, they helped establish Atlanta as a force in Hip-Hop, paving the way for future Southern artists and shifting the genre’s geographic focus.\nTheir willingness to address social issues and embrace diverse sounds inspired later acts like Outkast and contributed to a broader acceptance of alternative voices. Even decades later, their impact is recognized in both music and activism, with their songs and style continuing to inspire artists and audiences around the globe.\nAdult Contemporary Hip Hopis no different. Listen above and cop it onBandCamp.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "description": "Beyoncéhas reportedly been the victim of theft with a large quantity of her unreleased music stolen. According to Atlanta news outlet WSB-TV, a car belonging to the singer’s choreographer and dancer was broken into on July 8. The items stolen from the vehicle included a pair of suitcases confidential information as well as electronic goods such as laptops and AirPods. The confidential information is believed to include hard drives containing unreleased music as well as setlists for upcoming Cowboy Carter tour stops. One unidentified person has since been arrested in relation to the robbery. Atlanta police said in a statement: “On July 8, 2025, Atlanta Police Zone 6 officers responded to 99 Krog St. NE regarding a report of a theft from motor vehicle. Preliminary investigation revealed a Jeep Wagoneer was broken into at the location and two suitcases had been stolen. “Investigators with the Atlanta Police Department’s Larceny from Auto Unit led the investigation and have subsequently secured an arrest warrant for a suspect. At this time, the suspect remains outstanding, and their identity is not yet available for release.” Beyoncé recently suffered ascary moment during her hometown show in Houstonas a stunt went wrong. As part of the show, the pop icon was seated in a vintage Cadillac high above the crowd which was held in place by cables. However, the car began tilting to one side with Bey seen holding on to a flag pole for support. She could also be heard shouting: “Stop! Stop, stop, stop stop.” Bey then said later in the show: “If ever I fall, I know y’all will catch me.” The car was eventually lowered to the ground without incident. Beyoncé’s company, Parkwood Entertainment, issued a statement saying that there was a “technical mishap”. They added: “She was quickly lowered and no one was injured. The show continued without incident.” An earlier show in the tour in Paris saw Bey joined by husband, JAY-Z. Jay later made another guest appearance on the tour, surprising the crowd in Atlanta as he came out to perform their iconic collaboration “Crazy in Love” as well as his own 2003 song “Public Service Announcement”.",

The Clipse are yet to respond to Bieber looking to take aim at them. In recent weeks, Pusha T has not been shy in calling out his various ops. Pusha has vocalized his issues with Travis Scott, saying his issues with his former GOOD Music stablemate arose from him interrupting a recording session with Pharrell Williams in Paris. He said: “I just thought it was disrespectful. We don’t even want you here to be honest. We’re not here to hobnob with any rappers and I personally don’t like rappers who don’t rap. I don’t wanna hear that. I don’t want it. “So to come and interrupt the session and do something backhanded and not for nothing but I done had to put my arm around you before but to go along with the title – so be it – he does this numerous times. He’ll do it with his mentor, Ye. Pusha continued: “He was even instrumental in the whole beef now. The ‘Like That’ verse, egging that on. I don’t want nobody who don’t rap to egg nothing on. You don’t rap, stay out of rappers’ business. You specifically, stay out of rappers’ business. Don’t do that.” In a sit down withGQ,King Push destroyed Scott for playing people off against each otherand allegedly shady behavior. The Virginia native said: “I personally have been removed from that crew and those people for a minute. So, that’s where my issue comes in—like, dawg, don’t even come over here with that, because at the end of the day, I don’t play how y’all play. To me, that really was just like…he’s a whore. He’s a whore.”",

Lucas took that as a sign Skepta wanted to battle with the Londoner replying: “Hey Jonah, I wasn’t even gonna reply back but I’m a rapper’s rapper. I’m gonna respect the fact that you stood up and said something. The first man, you get me? But this is just another example of the ignorance. Jonah, if you was from the UK, fam? Quiet, bro, understand?” Drake also inserted himself into the feud and backed up Skepta’s original statement, commenting: “London rappers are the best lyricists in the world. No disrespect to America, but nobody in the world can outrap London rappers,” a response which Lucas found hilarious as he simply commented on social media with a laughing emoji.",

    "description": "Pusha Thas admitted that he was shocked by Def Jam’s attempts to blockKendrick Lamar‘s verse from the newClipsealbumLet God Sort Em Out. Clipse ended up departing the label following the dispute after refusing to remove Kendrick’s verse. Sitting down withBillboard, Pusha confessed Def Jam caught him off guard: “I was shocked by it actually. I was shocked at first. We haven’t been doing anything particularly. For the past two years, it was just creating the album and back and forth to Paris. It was no ill intent in creating that song. We weren’t on that type of time, so it was totally a shock from what I feel like the optics were enough to put a halt to something like that.” Pusha also shut down rumors that he recently secured Kendrick’s verse at one of his shows after being seen vibing in the crowd. He said: “I actually pulled up to the show just because. I was just tryna catch one, and Boston was a good one. It was awesome. People were mistaken, thinking I was getting the vocals. The vocals have been in, man.” The Virginia rapper recently explained how the Kendrick feature came to be. Speaking with Spotify, Pusha explained: “Clipse and Kendrick together, that speaks lyricism. I don’t think anyone wants anything other than that. There was a traffic of people coming in and out of the studio and one of the people just happened to be a person from Kendrick’s camp. “We let his folks hear the album. He called them and was like ‘listen, you need to get on this’. At this particular time, he was super busy. He sent them songs over. He called back laughing like ‘okay, I gotta do it, don’t worry about it, I wanna do two.’ The idea of right place, right time makes everything happen.” Speaking toGQ,Pusha Tdescribed how their relationship with the storied label crumbled over Lamar’s feature on “Chains & Whips”. He said: “They wanted me to ask Kendrick to censor his verse, which of course I was never doing. And then they wanted me to take the record off. And so, after a month of not doing it, Steve Gawley, the lawyer over there was like, ‘We’ll just drop the Clipse.’ But that can’t work because I’m still there [solo]. But [if] you let us all go… ”",

Thugger had previously promised fans thatUy Scutiwould drop before the end of June. Young Thug just told NBA YoungBoy to call his phone 👀💚pic.twitter.com/7wTEWNbr0F — Youngboy Snippets (@YoungboySnippet)July 3, 2025 He recently premiered a new track from the albumduring his headline performance at Summer Smash last month. It was the Atlanta star’s first live performance since his release from jail last year and he did not let fans down, bringing out Travis Scott as a special guest and delivering all of his best hits. Thugger also brought out Ken Carson and the two performed a collaboration that Slime described as “new shit”. The duo did not reveal a title for the track but the hook went:“My bitch, she bad / She stay stone cold / Where the diamonds at / She inside her nose.” Young Thug was previously supposed to perform at the 2022 iteration of the festival in 2022 alongside Gunna but the two were arrested on RICO charges before the event. Elliot Montanez, director of operations for Lyrical Lemonade, commented in a statement about Thugger finally getting to perform at the festival: “In a weird way, all of that happened with Summer Smash being one of the shows he was about to do before he went away for a little bit, and now Summer Smash being the first show [he’s doing] fresh out, it is full circle. “I just think it’s interesting. I’m definitely glad that moment will be at Summer Smash, where fans will interact with him in person for the first time in a minute. But it’s a beautiful, full-circle moment.” Thugger recently joked about quitting music to become a full time streamer. Appearing on Adin Ross’ Kick stream, Thugger found out that the controversial streamer was making millions of dollars and appeared interested in a career change. He said: “I’ma stop doing music and start streaming. I think I’m gonna stop.

Evan has just turned four months old after being welcomed into the Mathers family earlier this year. Hailie Jade recently said that she now understands her father’s struggle for privacybetter since becoming a parent herself. Hailie Jade gave birth to her first child in March of this year and has largely looked to protect her baby from the media spotlight. In an interview withPeople, the younger Mathers commented: “Having been in the spotlight for so long, I’ve learned the importance of balancing what I share publicly with what I keep private.” She continued: “Over time, I’ve come to understand the struggle my father faced — wanting to protect our privacy while also feeling proud and wanting to celebrate his kids.” Hailie Jade went on to say that it was a move she was looking to replicate now with her own family: “I feel the same way now. I want to share the proud, joyful moments that mean a lot to me, especially as a parent, but I’m also intentional about keeping certain parts of our lives just for us.” Hailie Jade named her first born Evan Marshall McClintockwith the baby boy’s middle name an obvious nod to his famous grandfather who’s real name is Marshall Mathers. Longtime family friend50 Centappears to gearing up for honorary fun uncle duties as hereposted Hailie’s photo of baby Evan on his own Instagram pageand said: “Congratulations. This is the best. WOW!” The news was also welcomed by Eminem’s adopted daughter Alaina, who commented: “Obsessed with this tiny human and could not be more in awe of YOU mama!!! Motherhood is such a beautiful thing and you make it look easy. I am SO proud of you and grateful you have Evan.” Eminem learned that he was going to be a grandfather ina surprise reveal in his music video for “Temporary,”which featured various daddy-daughter moments between him and Hailie from over the years. In the clip, the pair can be sitting outside when Hailie hands Em a custom jersey from his beloved Detroit Lions adorned with “Grandpa #1” on the back. She then shares her sonogram, much to her dad’s pure shock and joy.",

    "description": "Travis Scottappears to have been slammed by former longtime collaboratorMike Deanover the quality of his recent music. Dean, who has produced extensively for Scott since the beginning of his career, was absent from the credits on theJackboys 2compilation album. In a post on his Instagram Stories, Dean took aim at an artist for how they conducted themselves in the studio, remarks that seem to be aimed at Scott. Dean wrote: “Somewhere in the world, an engineer is being yelled at. Stop being a bitch because your music is weak now.” WhenJackboys 2dropped shortly afterwards, Dean simply commented “LOL”. Scott has yet to respond to Dean. Scott has also been forced to deal with remarks from Pusha T who accused the Houston native of moving shadily. In a sit down withGQ,King Push destroyed Scott for playing people off against each otherand allegedly shady behavior. The Virginia native said: “I personally have been removed from that crew and those people for a minute. So, that’s where my issue comes in—like, dawg, don’t even come over here with that, because at the end of the day, I don’t play how y’all play. To me, that really was just like…he’s a whore. He’s a whore.” He went on to explain that his issues with Scottstem from when he interrupted a studio session with Pharrell in Paris. He said: “I just thought it was disrespectful. We don’t even want you here to be honest. We’re not here to hobnob with any rappers and I personally don’t like rappers who don’t rap. I don’t wanna hear that. I don’t want it. “So to come and interrupt the session and do something backhanded and not for nothing but I done had to put my arm around you before but to go along with the title – so be it – he does this numerous times. He’ll do it with his mentor, Ye. Pusha continued: “He was even instrumental in the whole beef now. The ‘Like That’ verse, egging that on. I don’t want nobody who don’t rap to egg nothing on. You don’t rap, stay out of rappers’ business. You specifically, stay out of rappers’ business. Don’t do that.”",

On the song, Skepta took aim at Lucas with lines such as“Where I’m from, I’m a GOAT / Where you’re from, you’re a joke / SK turn you to a ghost, yo / Talkin’ like you’re lyrical miracle, oh please / Where I come from, that’s a default speed.” In response, Lucas filmed himself listening to the song and commenting: “Alright, say less, my boy.” The cross Atlantic feud kicked off when Skepta declared that UK rappers were better than their American counterparts. Say less@Skepta😈pic.twitter.com/rM6EDiifSp — Joyner Lucas (@JoynerLucas)July 13, 2025 Lucas took that as a sign Skepta wanted to battle with the Londoner replying: “Hey Jonah, I wasn’t even gonna reply back but I’m a rapper’s rapper. I’m gonna respect the fact that you stood up and said something. The first man, you get me? But this is just another example of the ignorance. Jonah, if you was from the UK, fam? Quiet, bro, understand?” Drake also inserted himself into the feud and backed up Skepta’s original statement, commenting: “London rappers are the best lyricists in the world. No disrespect to America, but nobody in the world can outrap London rappers,” a response which Lucas found hilarious as he simply commented on social media with a laughing emoji. Joyner previously challenged Meek Mill to a rap battle. Things kicked off when Lucas declared that he wanted to get back into battle rapping, specifically through Ultimate Rap League. Lucas initially said he was happy to take on any battle rapper URL put his way, but he then offered his own proposal. He wrote: “Let me do just 1 round at first so I can get my feet wet. I low key wish i can go againts [sic] one of my peers tho. Someone who ain’t seasoned in the ring already but lyrically fit. But…… on the other hand, maybe going againts a season [sic] vet is the fun part.” Lucas then picked who he wanted to challenge, writing: “Wasup @meekmill.” Meek Mill has not publicly responded to the challenge, but URL said in astatementtoAllHipHopthat they are working to make the battle happen. “For the last year, hip-hop is buzzing with excitement… that competitive edge is back in the mainstream… with that said, commercial artists have long turned to URL as the go-to platform for settling lyrical rivalries or proving their skills. If Joyner Lucas wants to challenge Meek Mill, we have the platform to make it happen.”",

    "description": "Kendrick Lamarhas received his props fromRakimafter the Compton legend shouted him out on his guest verse onClipse‘s “Chains & Whips”. On the song, Lamar made it clear just how much Hip Hop is indebted to the rap legend. He spat:“Let’s be clear, Hip Hop died again / Half of my profits may go to Rakim.” The God MC clearly listened to theLet God Sort Em Outstandout and responded in kind on social media. Rakim wrote on Instagram: “I salute you king. Thanks for the illest shout I heard in a long time, and keep up the incredible work my brother, you ain’t no joke!!!! Peace and blessings to you and yours.” Rakim previously praised Kendrick at the height of his feud with Drake last year. He said: “You know, a lot of people in that position won’t accept no challenge, because they got too much to lose. So, it was dope that these brothers put the mainstream success down and said, ‘Yeah, let’s do it.’” Rakim added: “Younger artists now know that there’s a difference. A lot of them didn’t even understand that. They just listened to the majority, not knowing that a lot of people don’t categorize what they were hearing as real Hip Hop. The battle was very needed for the genre. I tip my hat to them brothers. Let’s just hope that it stays to the music.” Rakim is not the only rap legend with some kind things to say about Kendrick. Fat Joe recently claimed that no West Coast artist had ever dominated like the “Not Like Us” rapperhas over the last couple of years. Speaking on his new podcastJoe and Jada, the “Make it Rain” star reflected on how Kendrick has become a radio staple since his beef withDrakestarted. Joe said: “What I can tell you is, boy, that Kendrick Lamar gets some spins in LA radio…” He added: “I was there last week. I’ve never seen nothing like that: Every single song, ‘Turn his TV off…’ What? It’s a fact. Kendrick Lamar gets played nine out of every 10 songs in L.A. right now. Not evenSnoop Dogg, not evenTupac Shakur— nobody from L.A. has dominated the paint like this guy… If you’re from L.A., you probably think there’s only one guy on Earth, Kendrick Lamar. I’m just keeping it a buck with you.”",

Sitting down for a chat withComplex, the Clipse star offered a brief summation of what he thought about the song. Asked if he liked “What Did I Miss”, Pusha simply replied: “No. Just not for me.” Pusha previously said that he was done speaking about Drake. He toldGQ: “I think after everything that had been done, I don’t think there was ever anything subliminal to be said ever again in life. Not only just musically, like bro, I actually was in Canada. I actually had a show and made it home. So, I can’t pay attention to none of that. I did the dance for real, not to come back and tiptoe around anything.” King Push also mocked his longtime nemesis for suing UMGover his feud with Kendrick Lamar. “I think after everything that had been done, I don’t think there was ever anything subliminal to be said ever again in life,” he said. “Not only just musically, like bro, I actually was in Canada.

Damn, it’s like it just kind of cheapens the art of it once we gotta have real questions about suing and litigation. Like, what? For this?” Pusha’s issues with Drake also led to him and Clipse parting ways with Def Jam ahead of the release ofLet God Sort Em Out, the just released reunion album from the two brothers. Pusha said that Def Jam wanted him to remove Kendrick Lamar’s guest featurefrom their album. He said: “They wanted me to ask Kendrick to censor his verse, which of course I was never doing. And then they wanted me to take the record off. And so, after a month of not doing it, Steve Gawley, the lawyer over there was like, ‘We’ll just drop the Clipse.’ But that can’t work because I’m still there [solo]. But [if] you let us all go… ” It was also revealed that Def Jam were concerned about the optics of two of Drake’s arch rivals teaming up on a track while his lawsuit against UMG was ongoing.",

    "description": "Drakehas been quick to celebrate his latest win as new single “What Did I Miss” debuted at the number two spot on the Billboard Hot 100. Drizzy was held off the top spot by Alex Warren’s “Ordinary” which has now been number one for six weeks. After the latest chart came out, the 6 God headed to his Instagram Stories to offer his reaction to the feat. He wrote: “Suppressor on the 1 spot. I’m taking that soon don’t worry one song or another rule changes and all.” Drake has been in a defiant mood of late, recently taking aim at his social media critics. Alongside a topless selfie, Drizzy wrote: “I’m wide awake for the nights that separate the type who get to it til they get it right from the type who just …type.” However, Drake’s post appeared to bring in more criticism with many commenters pointing out that his six pack appeared to be fake as it was much more defined than the rest of his body. It’s not the first time Drake has beenpelted with accusations that his stomach had been surgically enhanced. While soaking up the sun in Perth ahead of his Australian tour earlier this year, the 6 God shared a photo on his Instagram Stories of him shirtless in a swimming pool, with his toned torso on full display. Unfortunately for Drizzy, his summer body flex backfired as the jokes about his rumored reliance on cosmetic surgery and weight loss drugs came thick and fast. “Damn where did he get his abs from?” one user commented on Instagram, referencing a line fromKendrick Lamar‘s diss song “Euphoria.” Another completed the lyric by writing: “V12 it’s a fast one,” nodding to the slimming machine often used before liposuction procedures. Rick Rosshas also frequently taunted his former friend with accusations of going under the knife to change his appearance. The MMG mogul evenposted two side-by-side photos of Drizzy on social media last yearto support his claim that the rapper had gotten a nose job. “The bridge of your nose somehow got smaller @champagnepapi,” he wrote underneath the images, while also referring to him as “BBL Drizzy.”",

Speaking to Angie Martinez for herIRLpodcast, the controversial former Dipset member was asked if he had been trolling with his comments. Jones replied: “I mean you’re definitely correct. But I didn’t start it. There was a young gentleman that they asked a question to and his clip went viral. He was on a podcast and they asked him who’s more relevant: Jim Jones or Nas? That went super viral and that led to all these people with platforms to ask that question.” He added: “I gave people a prerequisite. I know how to go viral, this is easy. We’re in a community where everything goes viral… and turns into a revenue stream. I’m on everybody’s Explore page, I’m at the top of this page, the top of that page. You like me, don’t like me, know who I was… one click away from making me some money. I also have a record label, I have artists, I have music out. It makes it that much easier to know who Jim Jones is. I’m worried about myself when I make these moves. I know how to turn my negatives into a positive.” Jones then addressed the Nas comparisons directly: “Man, I didn’t know how many people loved Nas, though. I’m watching people go absolutely batshit crazy, like goddamn. But that’s hip-hop. There’s people that I adored as a fan too that I’ll probably go batshit crazy for in the same situation, I love it, that’s what the game was built on. Let’s not make no mistake, I put in a lot of work and I did a lot of incredible things that a lot of people have not gotten to do in this industry.” Last month, Jones said of Nas: “Check my track record, then check everybody else track record. Then go to Billboard and check all my entries then check all them n-ggas entries. I been spanking a lot of this shit. Pull up Nas’ Billboard entries, then pull up my Billboard entries.” Nas is still yet to reply to Jones’ comments.",

P explained: “It’s a blessing now to be able to transition into doing something that’s bigger than me. Being a servant is my most important job. I feel like hard work got me here, even though I didn’t know I was going to get this far in life.

I’m fine with growing up.” He also said of the future: “This is fun for me, like what I was made to do. I love these kids.

Every kid wanted to come to the Lakefront Arena and be a part of this. “I’m just so appreciative and blessed that God has given me this opportunity … to rebuild this program. We gonna change this.

    "description": "2Pacallegedly wantedSuge Knightto kill him after he had been mortally wounded in the Las Vegas shooting that ultimately ended his life. Speaking toPeoplefrom behind bars, the Death Row Records co-founder detailed his view of the night’s events. He explained: “I got out and tried to tell the officers what happened while I was bleeding everywhere. I then was getting Tupac out the car, even when the door was open. I had to go over there bleeding everywhere, take the seat belt off him.” According to Knight, Pac then asked him to end his life: “Kill me. Shoot me,” he claims the late rap legend said. 2Pac’s murder trial was recently delayed until next yearafter new evidence was uncovered. The ruling came after Keefe D (real name Duane Davis), who is the only person to ever be charged with the killing of the rap legend, filed a motion to delay the trial, citingnew witness testimony which apparently helps to prove his innocence. Judge Kierny said during the hearing: “It looks like there are quite a few things that are left to be done to get this case prepared so that Mr Davis can have effective assistance of counsel.” The judge also asked Keefe D if he agreed to the delay, which he did. In the aforementioned motion, Keefe D’s legal team argued that they needed more time to interview witnesses and do investigative work that was critical to their case. According to the defense, investigators have discovered witnesses who can prove that Keefe D was not at the scene of the murder, which occured in September 1996 on the Las Vegas strip. Keefe D has been in police custody since September 2023 whenhe was charged with orchestrating the fatal shooting of 2Pac, which marked the first arrest in the decades-old case. He alsorecently attempted to get his murder charge dismissed, claiming that he had previously agreed an immunity deal with law enforcement. The former Compton Crip told detectives in 2008 that he was involved in ‘Pac’s murder, but his lawyers argued that he made this admission as part of a proffer agreement, meaning anything he said could not be used against him in court, and that this agreement should still stand. Prosecutors denied that there was any evidence of such an agreement, whichthe judge ultimately agreed with, ruling in their favor.",

The Chicago rapper has been teasing a project entitledStar Linefor a while but announced that he was putting it back because he didn’t like how fans were talking about his work. In a video posted on Instagram last year, the Chance laid out his issues with his followers referring to his upcoming project as “the album” and not its official title when interacting with him on social media. “Alright, so this was the main point I was trying to make: stop calling it ‘the album,’” he said while riding on his tour bus. “And I don’t mean that in an ungrateful way. I’m grateful that people are putting in my comments, ‘Drop the album.’ “I’m not finna drop the album until y’all start calling itStar Line. I’m not gonna drop the project, I’m not gonna do these installations — I got so much shit ready.

But what I’m doing is something different. It’s something very specific. It’s calledStar Line. “So if y’all gonna press me for the project, don’t put ‘drop the album’ in my comments ’cause it makes me feel like y’all don’t know what’s going on. I’ve been saying one specific phrase for like two, three years now.

    "description": "Flavor Flavhas made a public plea for the government to ban access to guns across America. The Public Enemy legend penned an op-ed forNewsweekand described how he feels guns have made the country less safe. He wrote: “I fear for my kids when I drop them off at school. Our schools aren’t safe and our kids aren’t safe. This is because gun protection laws are weak. Guns are falling into the hands of the wrong people. I would know. I went to jail because of guns. I ended up on Rikers Island. So I am speaking from first-hand experience.” Flav added: “Fear and power are two of the biggest emotions that drive us. America is being built on fear. You have people who are scared. And these people are fighting for gun rights to protect themselves. They wouldn’t have to protect themselves if all guns were banned. Fear is a powerful, short-term motivator. We need to flip it so it can break through to be a positive and valuable resource. Let our fear of losing our children be more powerful than our fear of our next-door neighbor.” The legendary hype man continued: “Right now, it’s too easy for kids to grab their parents’ guns. They are motivated by fear of being disliked, fear of not being accepted, fear of being made fun of. It makes them feel powerless. Some choose to take their power back and show up those peers. This happens so often, we have started to become numb to it as a society. It’s barely in the news if it’s less than a handful of people who were killed, and then the news cycle moves onto something else… The hits just keep on coming… “School shootings are normalized. The lack of gun laws has created a violence epidemic here in the United States that is nowhere else in the world. This is domestic errorism.” Flav concluded by saying his and Chuck D’s concerns about guns led to a new Public Enemy track: “I hope this song, ‘March Madness’ reignites the conversation. I hope this song sparks change. I hope this anthem gives a voice to those who feel powerless against a system of power and greed. I hope we can come together to create a wall of unity with peace and togetherness that is so strong, no one can divide and tear us down.”",

Rumors have plagued the Philadelphia rapper ever since he was indirectly named in producer Lil Rod’s lawsuit as having sex with his friend and collaborator. Meek has repeatedly denied the claims and in a new interview withComplexsaid: “I truly believe it is a group of people aiming to tear down rappers, or Black entertainers involved in this culture through media platforms. He sets up a hypothetical, trying to explain the threadbare, flimsy nature of ‘truth’ on the internet. “There was never a way people could just put out one rumor, and say I raped a little girl … Now it’s in 15 publications that I raped a little girl. That’s defamation on any level, but it’s the way with social media and the internet.” He went on to address Diddy more directly: “When I come around from Philadelphia, I always come around with three, four people. I’ve never been in these types of environments without my guys around. A lot of people, they said sex parties. I attended New Year’s parties.

I can just say, for me, I would never step in anywhere that I see anything that doesn’t align with my morals.” Meek went on to say: “I’m being literally up front about it, talking about it in the open while [Diddy’s] on federal trial to make it known that I am not affiliated with Puff Daddy’s sexual life or personal life and never have been.” The “Dreams and Nightmares” rapper has previously offered up $100,000to anyone that can debunk the rumors about him. He wrote: “I wanna hire an investigative team 100k cash to find out every specific detail involving meek mill name to ‘Diddy’ Case…. I also want them to look at who is powering the media involving ‘meek’ anything to do with buddy! ‘Something not right.’” Meek later added: “The streets know wassup with me thats not the case….We talking about business side ,somebody powering these bad campaigns [shrug emoji] with ‘meeek mill’ again I got 100k for a thorough investigation of who’s powering and how exactly my name connect to this…”",

    "description": "SZAhas snapped back atNicki Minaj‘s lengthy social media tirade by claiming that she has turned down multiple feature requests from the Trinidadian rapper. Responding to Minaj’s rant about her looks and career, SZA wrote on X: “Nicki . You absolutely know my music and what I contribute cause you’ve asked for features twice to no response . In addition to rapping my lyrics on feeling myself ‘Cooking up the bass looking like a kilo’? Lol ur having a moment ..im not sure why but be blessed.” She also shared a screenshot of a text message from Minaj herself where they were reaching out to someone on SZA’s team to try and get the TDE star on the hook of a song. Minaj has been going at SZA relentlessly on social media with the issues between the pair seemingly coming from the fact the “Kill Bill” singer did not end up doing the hook for the proposed collaboration.

    "title": "Kendrick Lamar Receives Emmy Nomination For Super Bowl Performance",
    "description": "Kendrick Lamarhas received four Emmy Award nominations for his record breaking Super Bowl halftime show performance back in February. The iconic performance, which featured cameos from Samuel L. Jackson, Serena Williams and Mustard, is nominated for Outstanding Variety Special (Live), Outstanding Directing for a Variety Special, Outstanding Music Direction, and Outstanding Choreography (Variety/Reality). Kendrick previously won an Emmy for his role in the 2022 Super Bowl halftime show in which he performed alongside Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Eminem, 50 Cent and Mary J. Blige. Lamar is yet to comment on the nominations. Samuel L. Jackson previously claimed that the performance was “revolutionary”. The iconic actor appeared on Paloma Faith’sMad Sad Badpodcast and said: “I didn’t know what they were doing. It was kinda trippy because it wasn’t until dress rehearsal that when I looked up and I looked on that stage and I go, ‘Oh shit, that’s a flag. Ah, fuck, we’re being revolutionaries.’ Because I wasn’t listening or paying attention.” Jackson appeared throughout the performance, playing a version of Uncle Sam, essentially narrating Kendrick’s show. As well as social commentary, Kendrick’s Super Bowl performancemade headlines for featuring a number of jabs aimed at Drake. During the actual performance of “Not Like Us”, Kendrick self-censored the “certified pedophile” line but smirked to the camera as he rapped:“Say Drake, I hear you like ’em young / You better not ever go to cell block one / To any [bitch] that talk to him and they in love / Just make sure you hide your lil’ sister from him.” Dave Free, Lamar’s longtime creative partner, previously explained to theWall Street Journal,the artistic intention behind the performance. “We wanted this performance to have a cinematic and theatrical element to it. We can confidently say that there’s no Super Bowl performance that’s quite like this one,” he said. Free added that he and Kendrick prepared for the event by watching every single Super Bowl halftime performance, drawing particular inspiration fromBeyoncé,PrinceandMichael Jackson’s shows. “The feel of it is Black America. What does Black America look like, and how to control that narrative of what it means to be Black in America versus what the world’s perspective of that is,” he said.",

    "description": "Pusha Thas hit back at critics who say he only raps about drug dealing. Appearing on theJoe & Jada Podcast, the Clipse rapper was posed the question that his lyrics focus too much on drugs. Pusha hit back by saying: “You can’t please everybody but 23 years in this, I’m not tryna please nobody but myself, that’s what I care about. I know that my taste, my ear, and what it is that I wanna hear that resonates with that type of person, that’s the type of person I wanna talk to.” He added: “The person who says that… man, I’m sure I don’t even gel with you anyway. I’m positive I don’t like you. I take it with a grain of salt, but more importantly I know who my family is.” Pusha T responds to music critics who says he always raps about selling drugs and never switches topics. (🎥 Joe and Jada/YouTube)pic.twitter.com/hjwFqYYANe — The Art Of Dialogue (@ArtOfDialogue_)July 15, 2025 Pusha has made waves in recent weeks for comments he has made about Travis Scott. In an interview with Ebro on Apple Music, one half of the Clipse further explained how his issues with Scott stem from when he interrupted a recording session with Pharrell in Paris. He said: “I just thought it was disrespectful. We don’t even want you here to be honest. We’re not here to hobnob with any rappers and I personally don’t like rappers who don’t rap. I don’t wanna hear that. I don’t want it. “So to come and interrupt the session and do something backhanded and not for nothing but I done had to put my arm around you before but to go along with the title – so be it – he does this numerous times. He’ll do it with his mentor, Ye.” Pusha continued: “He was even instrumental in the whole beef now. The ‘Like That’ verse, egging that on. I don’t want nobody who don’t rap to egg nothing on. You don’t rap, stay out of rappers’ business. You specifically, stay out of rappers’ business. Don’t do that.” He also called out Scott for showing a lack of loyalty towards Kanye West: “I’ve already dealt with the lack of loyalty [to his] mentor, the guy he looks up to. I’ve been dealing with the corny shit that goes along with them. So it’s like, I’m in a whole ‘nother place. Don’t bring that over to bring that over to my house. I just wanted you to have that true context, man…and honestly, Frazier, you got to realize I’ve really been in Paris. I’ve really been making my joints. I’ve really been doing my shit.”",

On X, Metro wrote: “Would love to produce some WWE entrance themes. It’s a lifelong goal of mine.” WWE have yet to respond to Metro’s request but multiple rappers in the past have contributed theme songs for the company including Naughty by Nature, Three 6 Mafia and Lil Kim. La Flame famously appeared during the main event of WrestleMania 41 where he helped John Cena defeat Cody Rhodes. After pulling the referee out of the ring, Rhodes challenged the rapper to step up — a move that backfired when he was hit with Rhodes’ signature Cross Rhodes finisher. However – this became the perfect moment for Cena to seize the opportunity, and he took Rhodes down for what became his record-breaking 17th world championship title. Taking to Instagram with photos of his appearance, Travis captioned them, “I DONT WANT A RECEIPT I WANT BLOOOODDD AFTERJACKBOYS 2I NEEEEEDDD THAT.” Cody Rhodes had previously warned Travis Scott that he could expect a receiptafter smacking him in the face at Elimination Chamber in February. During the melee, La Flame landed a hard punch on Rhodes’ head as he lied face down on the floor,giving the 39-year-old a legitimate black eye and a ruptured ear drum. Scott has since begun wrestling training though it is not yet known if and when he will make his in-ring debut.",

Meanwhile, the Clipse reunion album is predicted to shift 90,000 units in its first week on sale, enough to land the highly acclaimed project the number four spot on the chart. Pusha T has been vocal in his distaste for former GOOD Music labelmate Scott in recent weeks. Travis Scott & Cactus Jack’s ‘JACKBOYS 2’ is projected to sell 253K units first week with a #1 debut on the Billboard 200 📈pic.twitter.com/boIPL3FMbM — Kurrco (@Kurrco)July 15, 2025 Pusha recently eviscerated Scott on the Clipse single “So Be It”, spitting:“You cried in front of me, you died in front of me / Calabasas took your bitch and your pride in front of me / Her utopia had moved right up the street / And her lip gloss was poppin’, she ain’t need you to eat.” In an interview withGQ,Pusha then explained that his reasons for dissing Scottwere a result of him shading Pharrell Williams on “Meltdown” which features a Drake verse with lines aimed at the legendary producer. He said: “The true context of that is we were in Paris, literally working, and he was calling to play P his new album. He came to [Pharrell’s] studio. He interrupted a session,” “He sees me and Malice there. He’s like, ‘Oh, man, everybody’s here,’ he’s smiling, laughing, jumping around, doing his fucking monkey dance. We weren’t into the music, but he wanted to play it, wanted to film [us and Pharrell listening to it]. And then a week later you hear Meltdown, which he didn’t play. He played the song, but not [Drake’s verse].” Pusha also accused Scott of displaying a lack of loyalty: “It’s the principle of what I’m saying. That filthy quality that they have about themselves, that lack of loyalty. Travis really has that. He’s proven. I just named three people that he does that type of behavior with. I’m just not one of them. Dog, I ain’t with that. This shit ain’t coming out of nowhere. Bro, I be cool with all these guys. Everybody you mentioned today, bro, I promise you they did the underhanded, weird shit.”",

    "description": "50 Centhas mockedDiddy‘s decision to enter rehab following his acquittal of sex trafficking charges. While Diddy was convicted of engaging in transportation for prostitution, he was found not guilty on the most serious charges in his highly publicized trial. As he awaits sentencing, it was reported that Diddy has entered a rehab program which aims to prevent domestic violence. The music mogul has also enrolled in a separate drug abuse program. It has also been reported that Diddy has been seeking help for his drug issues throughout his legal battle. However, one person who was not impressed by Diddy’s apparent attempts to improve himself, was of course, 50 Cent. Responding to the news that Diddy had entered the programs, 50 wrote on Instagram: “My manz did that program came home got high and caught another DV it don’t work.” Diddy previously entered rehab shortly after his attack on Cassie in a hotel corridor in 2016. After Diddy was cleared of the most serious charges in his trial,50 couldn’t help but be impressed. He wrote on Instagram: “Diddy beat the Rico,that boy a bad man ! he like the Gay John Gotti.” Fif then followed up by saying: “Get the fvck off my page talking about I’m supposed to be scared of the Gay Teflon Don!” Following the split verdict,Diddy was denied bail by Judge Arun Subramanianwho cited the record executive’s history of violent behavior. He will now stay in custody until sentencing, which is tentatively scheduled for October 3. The charges he was found guilty of carry a maximum sentence of 10 years each though it is thought to be unlikely that will be imposed on Diddy. In the aftermath of the verdict, Cassie filed a letter to the court arguing that Diddy posed a danger to the community if he was allowed out on bail. Her attorney Douglas Wigdor wrote: “Ms Ventura believes that Mr Combs is likely to pose a danger to the victims who testified in this case, including herself, as well as to the community.” After the judge made the decision to refuse Diddy bail, the rapper and producer could be heard saying to his family: “I’ll see you when I get out. We’re going to get through this.”",

There was a traffic of people coming in and out of the studio and one of the people just happened to be a person from Kendrick’s camp. “We let his folks hear the album. He called them and was like ‘listen, you need to get on this’. At this particular time, he was super busy. He sent them songs over. He called back laughing like ‘okay, I gotta do it, don’t worry about it, I wanna do two.’ The idea of right place, right time makes everything happen.” Kendrick’s verse on “Chains & Whips” hascaused controversy for the Virginia duo and led to them departing Def Jam.

He said: “They wanted me to ask Kendrick to censor his verse, which of course I was never doing. And then they wanted me to take the record off. And so, after a month of not doing it, Steve Gawley, the lawyer over there was like, ‘We’ll just drop the Clipse.’ But that can’t work because I’m still there [solo]. But [if] you let us all go… ” It was also revealed that Def Jam were concerned about the optics of two of Drake’s arch rivals teaming up on a track while his lawsuit against UMG was ongoing. The brothers paid a large sum to get out of their contract with Def Jam and keep their album intact. Their manager, Steven Victor, said toBillboard: “They said, ‘Find another deal, and let’s figure out a business.’ They didn’t drop us. They were like, ‘Pay us this money’ — which was an exorbitant amount of money, a shit ton of money — ‘and we’ll let you out the deal.’ That’s what happened. We paid them the money, an insane amount of money. It wasn’t, like, $200,000. It was a lot of money for an artist to come up with. They bought themselves out of the deal.”",

    "description": "Clipse’s long-awaited reunion albumLet God Sort Em Outdropped July 11 with big names featured likeNas,Kendrick LamarandTyler The Creator. But the absence of the once-speculatedJay-Zhas led to questions about the Brooklyn legend’s rumored feature. In an appearance onThe Breakfast Club,Pusha Taddressed the lack of a Jay feature.\n\"He was sent 'Chains & Whips,' 'M.T.B.T.T.F.', ['So Be It'],\" Push says. \"Hov had the album. It was all for him to...whatever he wanted to do.\"\n\"Nothing moved his spirit?” asks Charlamagne Tha God, to which Push responds:\n\"I don't know, man.”\nMaliceand Pusha T previously shared how difficult it was to land the Kendrick guest spot on this new Clipse album, as well. K. Dot’s appearance led to a rift between the duo and their label, Def Jam. The label was nervous about Kendrick Lamar and Pusha T together, given their shared history of beef withDrake. Def Jam wanted no parts of it.“They wanted me to ask Kendrick to censor his verse, which of course I was never doing,\" Push claimed. \"And then they wanted me to take the record off. And so, after a month of not doing it, Steve Gawley, the lawyer over there was like, ‘We'll just drop the Clipse.’ But that can't work because I'm still there [solo]. But [if] you let us all go…\"Longtime Clipse manager Steven VictortoldBillboardthat it wasn’t easy brokering their exit from Def Jam.“If you’re an artist, your whole life is to create art and put it out,” Victor says. “If someone’s telling you that you can’t do that, or you have to do it within the confines of whatever box they put you in, that’s like creative jail.”Jay-Z recently made an appearance on his megastar wife’s tour.Back in June, Beyoncé concluded the international leg of her Cowboy Carter and The Rodeo Chitlin’ Circuit Tour with a show in Paris and a guest appearance fromJay.

    "title": "Drake Said “Nobody Can Out-Rap London” and the Internet Had Some Thoughts",
    "description": "Drakejust gave London rappers a serious cosign, but some people aren’t happy with how far he went. During the second night of a three-night run of London’s Wireless Festival over the weekend, Drake brought out several London-centric artists during the show, including hometown stars Skepta, Central Cee and Dave. Drake also made a proclamation about the prowess of emcees out of London. He showed them props by bringing them onstage. But he took it like, 10 steps further moments later.\n“Nobody can out-rap London — nobody,” he told the crowd. “No disrespect to America. No disrespect to my country. But, nobody can out-rap London rappers. This is the best, this is the highest level. This is what I aspire to be.”\nNaturally, Drake’s comments led to some umm … extreme reactions on X (formerly Twitter). You can check out some of those for yourself below.Drake’s comments come on the heels of Skepta’s war of words with Boston rhymer Joyner Lucas, and the two rappers feeding the British vs. American rap debate online. After the two rappers’ pointed back-and-forth via Twitter, Skeptareleased the new track“Friendly Fire,” which takes aim at Lucas,Drake’s feud withKendrick Lamaris still front-and-center. With fans cheering K. Dot’s recent performance of “Not Like Us” in Drizzy’s hometown of Torontoback in June, Drake’s fans got a chance to offer a retort. At the Wireless Festival, the Finsbury Park crowd erupted into a chant of “f—k Kendrick” — and Drake responded.“Chubbs, grab me a shot. I’ll drink to that,” Drake said to his OVO compadre onstage.On the first night of the Wireless Festival, Drake performed an R&B-centric set with surprise guests Lauryn Hill, Bryson Tiller, Givēon, and PartyNextDoor. Saturday night was rap-focused, with Latto, 21 Savage, Sexyy Red, and Vanessa Carlton joining the rapper alongside the Brit acts.Burna Boy, Vybz Kartel and Popcaan helped Drake close things out on Sunday night.

    "description": "Jay-Zis legally addressing a man that has claimed that the hip-hop icon is his father.According to court documents obtained byUsWeekly, Jay-Z is asking a federal judge to intervene and called the recent federal lawsuit brought by Rymir Satterthwaite “just the latest” in “decades-long harassment of [Jay-Z].”\n“The fabricated allegations and claims have been addressed – and rejected — in multiple other courts,” the documents read. “And [Satterthwaite’s] continued harassment of [Jay-Z] and disregard of those orders has already resulted in a contempt order.”\nJay-Z told the judge that he only learned about Satterthwaite’s most recent lawsuit on June 3 and needs more time to put together an official response. Satterthwaite filed the federal lawsuit against Jay-Z on May 6.He claims that Jay-Z impregnated his mother in the 1990s; Satterthwaite also says Jay’s team committed fraud upon multiple courts and “exploited legal systems in multiple jurisdictions to suppress [Rymir’s] paternity claim and prevent legal accountability.” In his suit, he says he is not seeking back child support but damages from Jay-Z for his alleged actions — including the “wrongful dismissal” of his paternity suits seeking child support and college funds. He also said he suffered psychological distress, public embarrassment and stress-induced health and mental health complications.Satterthwaite claimed his car was shot six times, which he took as a clear “message intended to silence him.”In a recent social media harange against Jay and Roc Nation, Nicki Minaj re-posted a post from 50 Cent aboutthe paternity case. “Oh is this why he was trending the other day? Idk. I hope all is well,” she wrote. “To God be the glory.”The judge has yet to rule.\nJay-Z told the judge that he only learned about Satterthwaite’s most recent lawsuit on June 3 and needs more time to put together an official response.

    "title": "Here Are the Top 12 Performances From the 2025 Montreal International Jazz Festival",
    "description": "Modibo Keita points to a tear-soaked Stevie Wonderperformanceas one of his earliest and most distinct memories at the Montreal International Jazz Festival. Five days after Michael Jackson passed away 16 years ago, Stevie played the singer’s “I Can’t Help It” while crying on stage in front of 200,000 fans. “Those kinds of memories are why I got into this,” Keita says of the emotional moment. Now he’s responsible for helping create more of them.\nAfter stepping onto the local scene as a trombonist and freelance concert producer, he currently serves as a key talent booker for the world’s largest jazz festival. Since its inception, the fest has hosted over 300 acts, including roughly 200 that are free of charge. It’s an opportunity for fans, regardless of physical ability or financial means, to enjoy world-class live entertainment. And if you’re from the area, it’s essentially in your backyard.\n“I always say, being from Montreal, we sometimes take this for granted,” Keita says of the fest. “It’s just part of summer here, but not every city has this.”\nThis year’s festival bolstered a lineup of talent that both honors the genre’s legacy and pushes forward its DNA. From Nas to Esperanza Spalding and beyond, here are 12 highlights from this year’s Montreal International Jazz Festival.\n1. Mavis Staples opened the festival with familiar favoritesPhoto by Victor Diaz Lamich.Mavis Staples has a different meaning to every generation. In the 1960s and 1970s, The Staple Singers were one of the most dependable names in R&B, while also creating a meaningful impact as voices of authority in the civil rights movement. These days,Frank Ocean coversand Run the Jewels collaborations have opened Mavis up to a new audience, and the singer serves as a dependable elderly stateswoman.It is only right that such a trusted voice would headline the main outdoor stage for the festival’s opening night. From “City in the Sky” to “Respect Yourself,” the soon-to-be-87-year-old has not lost a beat. After some age-related wear and tear, her voice may be a little more gruff, but her messaging remains just as potent as when she came into the spotlight over 60 years ago.2. Nas takes rappers to a new plateau through a symphony orchestra performancePhoto by Victor Diaz Lamich.It only feels right for hip-hop’s most revered body of work to be paired with musicianship that boost its sophistication. Pairing himself with an arrangement put together by Derrick Hodge (who also performed at this year’s festival) and conducted by Orchestre symphonique de Sherbrooke’s Jean-Michel Maalouf, Nas played two sold-out nights of his seminalIllmaticalbum, backed by a symphony orchestra.There is no rap performer quite comparable to the experience. This is Nas’ ownSinatra at the Sands. It is only fitting to see such a historic body of work be met with the elegance and sophistication of an orchestral backing.“I wanted to be an MC and you guys made it happen for me,” the rapper told the crowd as a lush string section dramatized the otherwise laidback “Memory Lane (Sittin' in da Park).” “I thank you.” In turn, Nasir Jones displayed a profound reverence for the esteem of the venue, opting to cut back the cussing (particularly the N-word) throughout the performance.Following the orchestralIllmaticset, Mr. Jones kept the party going, running through a medley of hits with a four-piece band. From “The Don” to “One Mic,” Nasty Nas kept every attendee in the 3000-person hall on their feet. Each set felt distinctly different. Where the orchestra performance could be likened to the pristine of a fine dining soiree, the latter felt akin to carefree feelings of a summer cookout.3. Ben Harper stuns solo with a masterful acoustic set“I care as much about this festival as I do this craft,” Ben Harper expressed in his return to the Montreal Jazz Festival. “I love it so much, always have.”It is hard to make an opera hall of some 3,000 fans feel intimate, but Harper rose to the challenge. In this solo acoustic set, all he needed was a microphone, piano, and an assortment of guitars to make the room his own. With over two hours of songs and stories, Harper walked his dedicated fans through his life and times. This included many tales of spending time at his grandparents’ music store in Claremont, California, which included regular patrons such as George Harrison and Montreal’s patron saint, Leonard Cohen. A cover of the latter’s “Hallelujah” was especially moving.Between the beautiful strums of his guitar, we are reminded that Harper is in many ways the prototype for John Mayer. He’s soft with his touch and a true savant, able to play any song requested with only a moment’s notice. His all-acoustic set at the prestigious Salle Wilfrid-Pelletier only accentuated such a notion.4. Thundercat reminds us that he is more than just his viral hitsPhoto by Victor Diaz Lamich.It’s been over five years since Thundercat blessed his fans with a new album. Inviting a child in attendance to come dance onstage for “Funny Thing” and “Them Changes” suggested the stakes may be higher for when the time comes to release new music, with TikTok taking his popularity to new heights.However, don’t let the viral popularity get things twisted: Thundercat has not lost touch with his roots. At heart, the funk bassist is still a commanding presence with his instrument, with his fancy fingerwork putting his crowd in a state of hypnosis. Backed by longtime touring mates, keyboardist Dennis Hamm and drummer Justin Brown, the audience was treated to a set consisting largely of new, unreleased tracks. This included a healthy amount of instrumental tracks, along with others co-written by fellow Californian talent Remi Wolf.“When’s it coming out?,” an audience member heckled. The Brainfeeder signee was coy with his reply, “A lady never kisses and tells…,” he joked.5. Kid Koala plays puppetmaster to our heartstringsPhoto by Victor Diaz Lamich.Hometown hero Kid Koala, best known as one-third of Deltron 3030, returned to the Montreal Jazz Festival for six performances of Storyville Mosquito, his immersive and ever-unique puppet show, which first debuted in 2019.With eight cameras, 75 puppets and 20 miniature sets, Storyville Mosquito is a unique story. Koala developed the story “Before I had the budget for a marketing team. I was later told that the mosquito is one of the least liked bugs,” he revealed to an eruption of laughter.The multidisciplinary show tells the story of a mosquito who uproots his life to a booming metropolis in hopes of breaking into the music industry as a clarinet player. Along with the aforementioned technical specs, Storyville Mosquito is brought together by live instrumentalists, including Koala on the turntables.Kid Koala is a jack of all trades, and this performance incorporates all of what he does well. Above all, Storyville Mosquito is a story with tremendous heart that is sure to bring a smile to children and adults alike.6. Anomalie succeeds in spontaneity alongside Snarky Puppy band membersPhoto by Victor Diaz Lamich.In the true spirit of jazz improvisation, Montreal piano savant Anomalie’s series of concerts at the festival saw him pairing up with a different member of famed jazz fusion band Snarky Puppy each night. The catch? He had never played with any of the other performers beforehand — practice or otherwise.“He’s incredibly talented on the keys, but beyond that, he’s just a massive artistic mind,” explained Keita. “The whole thing really speaks to the essence of collaboration…These musicians often use the festival as an opportunity to collaborate with artists they admire or dream of playing with. We have the perfect platform to make that happen.”Despite never playing together, Anomalie and drummer Larnell Lewis made for a seamless pairing. With the former leading the charge, the pair explored a diverse sound palette, with the jam veering into funk, techno and beyond. Watching the Montrealer’s fingers weave through the keys was simply intoxicating, as was Lewis’ adept ability to complement everything he played. Trust is the foundation of any successful collaboration. In their first and perhaps only time playing alongside one another, Anomalie and Lewis created lightning in a bottle.7. The Budos Band ride off into the Montreal sunsetThe Budos Band is an all-star selection of Daptone Records royalty, with various members having played in backing bands for the likes Sharon Jones, Charles Bradley and Lee Fields over the years. Budos Band are a blended family who, thanks to several placements throughout the first season ofThe Bear,are at long last getting their own moment to bask in the spotlight.The horn-heavy ensemble sounds akin to Charlie Brown dropping acid in a room full of his teachers. They are country western meets blaxploitation, what would be the soundtrack to Dolomite riding off into the sunset on a stallion. Two decades deep into their run as a band and it’s hard to comprehend how The Budos Band are yet to score a film or series, but their performance at MTELUS was nothing short of cinematic.8. Christone \"Kingfish\" Ingram carries the legacy of blues greats before himPhoto by Victor Diaz Lamich.Christone “Kingfish” Ingram is having a year. From his cameo inSinners, to a world tour, and a new album out in September, it feels as if the Mississippi talent has the world in his hands.Ingram is an ultimate showman. Talent aside, his on-and-off-stage antics are at the intersection of Action Bronson and Jimi Hendrix. From playing the guitar with his tongue, to waddling through the crowd for a solo, the outdoor evening set for several thousand fans was nothing short of entertaining.No gimmicks were necessary to make this a compelling show. Kingfish plays with tremendous soul. His eyes are closed the entire time, maneuvering his guitar in such a way that it bares a voice of its own.Following his performance, Ingram was honored with the B.B. King Blues Award, joining the ranks of genre greats such as Taj Mahal, George Thorogood and his longtime mentor, Buddy Guy. It was a moment that signaled a passing of the torch, elevating thiskingto a certified guitar god.9. PJ Morton shines on the solo tipIt is somewhat baffling to wrap your head around PJ Morton being a keyboardist for a band as banal as Maroon 5 when his solo work is so full of texture and richness. His songs feel handcrafted and made with love in contrast to Adam Levine and company’s descent into empty radio drab.For his performance at the TD Stage, the musician took Montreal to church. Morton wears his Stevie Wonder influence proudly on his sleeve; you can hear the influence in practically every note and musical direction. He emphasises this in the setlist, declaring his collaborations with Wonder, including 2022’s “Be Like Water,” among the highlights of his career. Morton’s six-piece band feels tight-knit and coordinated, offering the crowd musical soul food to end the festival’s first weekend on a high note.10. La Reezy makes his case for a future dominant force in hip-hopPhoto by Victor Diaz Lamich.Fresh off of cosigns from both Tyler, the Creator and Kendrick Lamar, La Reezy was ready to live up to his high praise. At only 19 years of age, the New Orleans native has a catalogue deep enough to sustain an hour-long set. He already has five projects under his belt, including the recently released collaborative EP with mentor PJ Morton,Pardon Me, I’m Different.As animated as he is lyrical, it comes to no surprise of how he has charmed some of rap’s most elite.I am buying my La Reezy stock low. The performance I witnessed from the young talent asserts why he is worthy of the world’s attention and a name to watch in the coming years. Praise from powerhouse names, especially Tyler and Kendrick, does not come a dime a dozen. His elite pen game and crowd control offer a compelling case for his potential. The rapper seems well-positioned for world domination, all he needs is for the world to latch on.Local rappers elevate their craft for the festival stagePhoto by Victor Diaz Lamich.“Part of our role is helping artists understand how to exist in a festival ecosystem like ours, one that values live performance across genres,” says festival programmer Modibo Keita on the responsibility of the festival.“Mike Shabb is a great example. He usually doesn’t perform with a live band, but we worked closely with his team to build a format that would make this performance feel special.”Originally hailing from Quebec’s Eastern Townships, Mike Shabb moved to Montreal at age 18 to pursue a professional career in music. Similarly, rapper Nyota Parker bounced from Cape Town to New York City before eventually landing in Montreal. Both took their talents to the intimate outdoor Club Montreal Loto-Quebec stage for inaugural festival performances.In each case, the artists understand the prestige of the fest, each opting to incorporate live bands in their performances and in Parker’s case, even a squad of b-boy backup dancers.The performances offered both rappers the shot to expand their reach to their hometown crowd. While Shabb’s street elegant sounds offered an ample nightcap on Canada Day, Parker’s Native Tongues-inspired sound fit right in for her late afternoon appearance. Montreal has no love for losers, and both artists built a compelling case for future fans in the city in which they reside.12. Esperanza Spalding closes the festival with charmPhoto by Victor Diaz Lamich.Among some of the most baffling and misogynistic lyrics from Drake’sFor All the Dogscame when Esperanza Spalding caught strays on “Away From Home,” with the rapper airing his grievances over losing the coveted Best New Artist award to her in 2011. And although Drake may perceive the loss as a chink in his armor, Spalding’s talent speaks for itself.From the opening notes of \"I Want it Now,\" the audience is introduced to a true showwoman. She moves with intrepidness, with vocal chops and rich instrumentation akin to a Broadway performance. Spalding shifts between vocals, upright bass and bass guitar, a true talent on all fronts. She woos the crowd not only with song, but with a plethora of interludes in between.“I spend more time on my phone than praying,” she confesses at one point of the night. “I would like to take a moment to sing to your spine,” she declares at another moment. Such shower thoughts feel akin to what one would find on anAndré 3000 jumpsuitduring the OutKast reunion tour.Nearly 15 years later, it’s clear that the Grammys got it right. Esperanza Spalding is a golden child of contemporary jazz, and having her close out the festivities for the Montreal Jazz Festival’s 45th edition only felt right.\nPhoto by Victor Diaz Lamich.\nMavis Staples has a different meaning to every generation.

He had never played with any of the other performers beforehand — practice or otherwise.\n“He’s incredibly talented on the keys, but beyond that, he’s just a massive artistic mind,” explained Keita. “The whole thing really speaks to the essence of collaboration…These musicians often use the festival as an opportunity to collaborate with artists they admire or dream of playing with. We have the perfect platform to make that happen.”\nDespite never playing together, Anomalie and drummer Larnell Lewis made for a seamless pairing. With the former leading the charge, the pair explored a diverse sound palette, with the jam veering into funk, techno and beyond. Watching the Montrealer’s fingers weave through the keys was simply intoxicating, as was Lewis’ adept ability to complement everything he played. Trust is the foundation of any successful collaboration. In their first and perhaps only time playing alongside one another, Anomalie and Lewis created lightning in a bottle.\nThe Budos Band is an all-star selection of Daptone Records royalty, with various members having played in backing bands for the likes Sharon Jones, Charles Bradley and Lee Fields over the years. Budos Band are a blended family who, thanks to several placements throughout the first season ofThe Bear,are at long last getting their own moment to bask in the spotlight.\nThe horn-heavy ensemble sounds akin to Charlie Brown dropping acid in a room full of his teachers. They are country western meets blaxploitation, what would be the soundtrack to Dolomite riding off into the sunset on a stallion. Two decades deep into their run as a band and it’s hard to comprehend how The Budos Band are yet to score a film or series, but their performance at MTELUS was nothing short of cinematic.\nPhoto by Victor Diaz Lamich.\nChristone “Kingfish” Ingram is having a year. From his cameo inSinners, to a world tour, and a new album out in September, it feels as if the Mississippi talent has the world in his hands.\nIngram is an ultimate showman. Talent aside, his on-and-off-stage antics are at the intersection of Action Bronson and Jimi Hendrix. From playing the guitar with his tongue, to waddling through the crowd for a solo, the outdoor evening set for several thousand fans was nothing short of entertaining.\nNo gimmicks were necessary to make this a compelling show. Kingfish plays with tremendous soul. His eyes are closed the entire time, maneuvering his guitar in such a way that it bares a voice of its own.\nFollowing his performance, Ingram was honored with the B.B. King Blues Award, joining the ranks of genre greats such as Taj Mahal, George Thorogood and his longtime mentor, Buddy Guy. It was a moment that signaled a passing of the torch, elevating thiskingto a certified guitar god.\nIt is somewhat baffling to wrap your head around PJ Morton being a keyboardist for a band as banal as Maroon 5 when his solo work is so full of texture and richness. His songs feel handcrafted and made with love in contrast to Adam Levine and company’s descent into empty radio drab.\n\nFor his performance at the TD Stage, the musician took Montreal to church. Morton wears his Stevie Wonder influence proudly on his sleeve; you can hear the influence in practically every note and musical direction. He emphasises this in the setlist, declaring his collaborations with Wonder, including 2022’s “Be Like Water,” among the highlights of his career. Morton’s six-piece band feels tight-knit and coordinated, offering the crowd musical soul food to end the festival’s first weekend on a high note.\nPhoto by Victor Diaz Lamich.\nFresh off of cosigns from both Tyler, the Creator and Kendrick Lamar, La Reezy was ready to live up to his high praise. At only 19 years of age, the New Orleans native has a catalogue deep enough to sustain an hour-long set. He already has five projects under his belt, including the recently released collaborative EP with mentor PJ Morton,Pardon Me, I’m Different.As animated as he is lyrical, it comes to no surprise of how he has charmed some of rap’s most elite.\nI am buying my La Reezy stock low. The performance I witnessed from the young talent asserts why he is worthy of the world’s attention and a name to watch in the coming years. Praise from powerhouse names, especially Tyler and Kendrick, does not come a dime a dozen. His elite pen game and crowd control offer a compelling case for his potential. The rapper seems well-positioned for world domination, all he needs is for the world to latch on.\nPhoto by Victor Diaz Lamich.\n“Part of our role is helping artists understand how to exist in a festival ecosystem like ours, one that values live performance across genres,” says festival programmer Modibo Keita on the responsibility of the festival.\n“Mike Shabb is a great example. He usually doesn’t perform with a live band, but we worked closely with his team to build a format that would make this performance feel special.”\nOriginally hailing from Quebec’s Eastern Townships, Mike Shabb moved to Montreal at age 18 to pursue a professional career in music. Similarly, rapper Nyota Parker bounced from Cape Town to New York City before eventually landing in Montreal. Both took their talents to the intimate outdoor Club Montreal Loto-Quebec stage for inaugural festival performances.\nIn each case, the artists understand the prestige of the fest, each opting to incorporate live bands in their performances and in Parker’s case, even a squad of b-boy backup dancers.\nThe performances offered both rappers the shot to expand their reach to their hometown crowd. While Shabb’s street elegant sounds offered an ample nightcap on Canada Day, Parker’s Native Tongues-inspired sound fit right in for her late afternoon appearance. Montreal has no love for losers, and both artists built a compelling case for future fans in the city in which they reside.\nPhoto by Victor Diaz Lamich.\nAmong some of the most baffling and misogynistic lyrics from Drake’sFor All the Dogscame when Esperanza Spalding caught strays on “Away From Home,” with the rapper airing his grievances over losing the coveted Best New Artist award to her in 2011. And although Drake may perceive the loss as a chink in his armor, Spalding’s talent speaks for itself.\nFrom the opening notes of \"I Want it Now,\" the audience is introduced to a true showwoman. She moves with intrepidness, with vocal chops and rich instrumentation akin to a Broadway performance. Spalding shifts between vocals, upright bass and bass guitar, a true talent on all fronts. She woos the crowd not only with song, but with a plethora of interludes in between.\n“I spend more time on my phone than praying,” she confesses at one point of the night. “I would like to take a moment to sing to your spine,” she declares at another moment. Such shower thoughts feel akin to what one would find on anAndré 3000 jumpsuitduring the OutKast reunion tour.\nNearly 15 years later, it’s clear that the Grammys got it right. Esperanza Spalding is a golden child of contemporary jazz, and having her close out the festivities for the Montreal Jazz Festival’s 45th edition only felt right.",

    "title": "A Clipse Reunion Isn’t Nostalgia – It’s a Statement of Cultural Permanence",
    "description": "As the day of Clipse’s long-awaited reunion album,Let God Sort Em Out, approached, the celebrated rap duo composed of brothers Terrance “Pusha T” and Gene “Malice” Thornton was the talk of hip-hop streets near and far. Those roads look much different than what the duo stepped foot onto on a warm summer day in 2002 with their debut albumLord Willin’. CDs were the preferred mode of listening at that time, while digital music was largely found on peer-to-peer file-sharing services like Napster, Kazaa, and Rhapsody. There was no Facebook, Twitter, or TikTok to spread the word, as magazines, DJs, and radio stations served as the primary channels to discover what was hot and the need-to-know.\nIn the grand scheme of pop culture, few things from the early 2000s still hold major relevance in the now mid-2020s, and even fewer have been able to maintain it without conforming to an ever-changing industry. Not Clipse, though; you’ll be hard-pressed to find any egregious differences between a Clipse album in 2002 and one in 2025. Coke raps delivered from pristine Pyrex measuring cups are still the main product, while Pharrell — now sans Chad Hugo — is still crafting left-of-center beats for the duo to tackle. A higher power is still the only force with more dominion than Clipse; they initially let go and let God withLord Willin’, and that principle remains onLet God Sort Em Out.Clipse still being revered as “cool” in 2025 can be attributed to many things. Pusha T’s solo career after the duo’s disbandment to close the first decade of the 2000s kept their legacy alive while also adding fuel to the loud “could have”-“should have”-“would have” calls for a reunion. Their early proximity to both Pharrell and Chad Hugo, who continued to thrive into the 2010s and beyond, ensured that the Clipse story would live on as The Neptunes' story can’t be told without it, as seen in Pharrell’s 2024 animated biographyPiece By Piece. There are certainly more things to explain Clipse’s relevance nearly three decades in, but ask Pusha T and Malice and they’ll probably tell you it has much as music to do with their music as it does their determination to never be less than the henchmen – both as rappers and as people – that rode with Jesus Christ on the cover ofLord Willin’. To know Clipse is to know two things: perseverance and principle.Those traits are deeply entwined into the ethos of Clipse, and fans were once again reminded of it during Pusha and Malice’s promotional run for the album, as the duo detailed a label dispute – the most recent ofmanyin their career – they had with their now-former label Def Jam over the legendary imprint’s attempt to censor and even remove Kendrick Lamar’s verse on “Whips And Chains.” According to Pusha, Def Jamclaimedthat their request was over Kendrick’s mention of a “trump card,” though he believes it’s tied more to the label’s ongoing lawsuit with Drake and their belief that Kendrick was subliminally dissing Drake on “Whips And Chains” (which, as of press time, he was not).Regardless, the audacity of Def Jam to (allegedly) make such a request was a grave violation of Clipse’s principles (or, more specifically, Pusha’s, who hardly conceals his disdain about the situation each time he speaks about it). That yet another Clipse album, this time their first in roughly four presidential terms, was held up yet again, forced Push to… well, push through to ensure that hip-hop finally received their big moment. Def Jam agreed to release the duo, but that wasn’t enough for Pusha; as confirmed by the rapper’s manager Steven Victor, Ziplock P reportedly paid a “seven-figure sum” to free both himself (as a solo artist) and Clipse from their contractual obligations. A distribution deal with Roc Nation was then signed, granting a smooth runway forLet God Sort Em Outto take flight.Label disputes are embedded into the Clipse DNA as much as Virginia, coke raps, and The Neptunes beats. The first time around presented itself as a somewhat exciting challenge to prove doubters wrong and overexceed expectations. The second time ushered in frustrations and questions about the requirements needed to be met in order to operate without restriction. Every time after that? Well, that’s just plain disrespect, considering their accolades and cultural impact. After hurdling label issues in 1999 (when Elektra Records shelved their original debutExclusive Audio Footage), 2004 (when work onHell Hath No Fury– released in 2006 – was halted after a label merger left them stuck on Jive Records, who neglected them in favor of pop acts), and 2018 (when Pusha T faced censorship in the aftermath of “The Story Of Adidion”), you can understand Pusha’s disgust when he and his brother once again faced off with Industry Rule No. 4080. It went against the principle of rap and business, but another chance to triumph against lesser beings wasn’t out of reach for Push and Malice; it’s what they always do.Without their perseverance, there’s no “Grindin’.” The record served as a reset for Clipse after their Elektra Records troubles and eventual freedom. It was another chance for Pusha and Malice to seize the attention of the music world – and that they did.“I’m tryna show y’all who the f*ck I am,”Pusha demands on his opening verse for “Grindin’,” and the world listened. Clipse has never been driven by the glitz and glamour of the music world, and Malice says as such to start the song’s third verse when he quips,“My grind’s bout family, never been about fame.”Twisting and contorting oneself for a chart-topping single or album, a Grammy, or other accolades is not something Clipse has done or ever plans to do. To discredit Clipse for any perceived commercial shortcomings is to not know of the world that Pusha and Malice come from and speak to: one that is driven by principle, integrity, and loyalty. So when Pusha ends “So Be It” with a series of scathing shots toward onetime labelmate Travis Scott (“You cried in front of me, you died in front of me / Calabasas took your b*tch and your pride in front of me / Her Utopia had moved right up the street / And her lip gloss was poppin’, she ain’t need you to eat”), that isn’t a clout chaser-esque pursuit for notoriety; it is just a response to a simple violation.Their principles are why they took issue with Birdman’s refusal to pay Pharrell for producing his 2002 single “What Happened To That Boy.” That rift jump-started what would turn into one of hip-hop’s biggest and longest-running beefs, simply because Pusha is not one to stand for any disrespect. So when Lil Wayne stood beside Birdman, Clipse mocked him with “Mr. Me Too” and Pusha later held up a mirror to show Wayne his ugliest blemishes with “Exodus 23:1.” When Drake tagged himself into the beef, Push — ever the professional low-road taker — made a uniquely crafted mirror for The Boy with “The Story Of Adidon.” Even Kendrick Lamar referenced Pusha on “Euphoria,” his own vitriolic attack against the Toronto rapper, which the brothers called “incredible” and “a master class.” However, Malice would love not to talk about these kinds of things and people. “I despise… I could vomit every time I have to hear about someone else’s name in our interviews,” he said in aNew York Timesinterview. Despite this, he’s not surprised that it comes up. “I’m cool because I’ve seen it before,” he continued. “I didn’t expect much to change.” If the music industry wasn’t going to change in the many,manyyears since 2009’sTil the Casket Drops, then Pusha and Malice sure as hell weren’t going to either.WithLet God Sort Em Outnow available, Malice (a grandfather!) and Pusha (a great-uncle!) are a testament to how rappers can age gracefully in a supposedly “young person’s game.” The “concept” of ageism in hip-hop isn’t real, and Clipse’s reunion is a prime example of how time doesn’t always call for change. Rap’s stigma as a so-called “young man’s game” wrongfully ignores its denizens who literally grew up with a culture that just reached middle age itself. There is always a space for what once was to still be; it’s just a matter of how willing one is to stand firm on their beliefs, trust the craft, the systems, and people who never did you wrong, and never lose touch with your identity. Pusha T and Malice have done all of the above as Clipse. They controlled what their rap skills and artistic vision allowed them to, and as for the rest, well, they let go and let God sort 'em out.\n\nIn the grand scheme of pop culture, few things from the early 2000s still hold major relevance in the now mid-2020s, and even fewer have been able to maintain it without conforming to an ever-changing industry.

    "description": "Michael Nash, EVP and Chief Digital Officer atUniversal Music Group, delivered a keynote presentation at the UN’s AI for Good summit in Geneva on Tuesday (Jul. 8)According to Music Business Worldwide, the summit gathers UN decision-makers, politicians, ambassadors, and other stakeholders to discuss AI in the context of the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Nash offered insights into how UMG is approaching artificial intelligence, and why he believes “market-based solutions are the answer” to AI in music.\n“In our artist-centric vision, AI innovation can drive music culture,” Nash said. “And in so doing, generate even greater benefits to the quality of life on this planet.”\nLast month,Timbalanddrew criticism after he announced that he was signing an A.I. artist. Similarly,Erykah BaduandAlchemistalso faced some backlash when it was revealed that the single artwork for their track “Next To You“ was generated by A.I. But Nash argues that artists will still be the focus for UMG, the biggest music licensor in the world.“Universal’s strategy on A.I. is based on a simple philosophy: center the conversation on artists, defend their rights and interests, and from that foundation, forge new creative and commercial opportunities,” Nash explained.The rise of A.I. in creative arts has led to anxiety about how labels will approach the technology going forward. Nash addressed those concerns while advocating for an embrace of copyright and looking to the future.“Copyright is not the enemy of innovation, quite the opposite,” Nash stated. “Media tech convergence predicated on respect for copyright has produced a multi-trillion Euro economy, and that started with Apple marrying iPod with iTunes in 2003 as a critical early step embracing licensed music [to] create the first trillion dollar company.”“You can’t forge new business models with no rights,” Nash said. “If you don’t claim a seat at the dinner table, you might wind up on the menu.”Nash also downplayed The Velvet Sundown, an A.I.-generated band that has drawn tremendous media scrutiny this month. “A lot of novelty will come along,” said Nash. “People are talking about Velvet [Sundown], which is this fake A.I. artist [project], you know, maybe a conceptual project,” he added.“There’s been a lot of publicity about that. Because of all the publicity, they have 1 million listeners on Spotify. That would not break them into the top 10,000 acts in terms of the size of the monthly [listening], because these are huge platforms that have tremendous volume.”\nLast month,Timbalanddrew criticism after he announced that he was signing an A.I. artist.

    "title": "‘Ironheart’ Director on Dominique Thorne, Ryan Coogler and Repping for Chicago",
    "description": "Ironhearthas made its debut on Disney+ and the Marvel series is drawing a lot of attention. The story of RiRi Williams (Dominique Thorne) a tech genius thrust into a shadowy world of criminals and magic, is executive-produced by Ryan Coogler and is set in Chicago. Those two factors were undeniably important to director Sam Bailey. Bailey helmed the first three episodes of the show (streaming now) and spoke to Okayplayer about working with Coogler, why she’s eager for the world to embrace Thorne and whyIronheartis a love letter to her hometown.\nOkayplayer:Leading up to its release,Ironheartwas one of the summer's most-anticipated shows. What excites you most about being involved with this project?\nSam Bailey:I think what excites me the most is the ability for people to see Dominique Thorne and this beautiful ensemble we've put together and to populate this world that is both grounded and magical. This show is unlike anything I've ever seen in the Marvel Universe, so I'm excited for people to experience it and just be down for the ride.\nWhen did you first become involved with the series?\nI was hired in late 2021, and then there was a lot of creative preparation and development that followed. I think we started filming in 2022.\nAs a storyteller, what did you want to accomplish with your episodes?\nI was really drawn to the story of Riri. It was important to me to not only give her character time to have an emotional journey and introduce audience members to her in a deeper way, but also to build out the people around her so that she wasn't ever fully isolated. And, also to give all of the people in the ensemble something for the audience to remember them by. I think that was really exciting for me.\nOn a technical level, building a real cinematic language and experience within the show was also important. The show constantly grapples with the groundedness versus the fantastical element, magic versus technology, and analog versus digital. Ante Chang, our cinematographer for the first three episodes, and I really wanted to play with that in the visual language as well. It was both something that we wanted to get in terms of the emotion, but also to have the cinematic language of the show reflect those themes throughout.\n- YouTubewww.youtube.com\nHow doesIronheartfit into the MCU–and what do you think makes it stand out?\nIronheartfits into the MCU because Riri Williams is a superhero, an anti-hero, and a complex character, much like many of the other characters in the MCU. I mean, in a very obvious way, what stands out is that it’s the first series that the MCU has made that surrounds and centers a young Black woman, so that obviously makes her stand out for many reasons. However, I think she definitely falls in line with all the other characters who are dealing with a lot of trauma and having to navigate that, as well as their flaws, and figure out how to rise to the occasion.\nRyan Coogler has said it was important for Black women to tell this story. How would you describe Coogler's involvement in the show?\nHe’s an EP on the show, and he also introduced Riri’s character inWakanda Forever,so I think he has real skin in the game in terms of Riri and her journey. We all wanted to live up to the standard that he had created withBlack Panther, both culturally, emotionally, and visually. He was there before I was brought on.\nYou’re a Chicago native and the city plays a major role in the story. How did your Chicago roots impact your approach toIronheart?\nI think it made me feel a responsibility to showcase the version of the city that I know. It was really exciting for me to be able to introduce Chicago to the MCU and to do it creatively, especially at a time when cities were really feeling the effects of the pandemic. To have the ability to stamp Chicago's role in this really magical universe felt like a heavy sense of responsibility, but also gave me a huge amount of excitement because I've always highlighted Chicago in a lot of my indie work. This felt like having the ability to do that with so many more resources, which generated a lot of excitement for me, and I took it very seriously.",

    "title": "The Top 5 Moments From The Weeknd’s MetLife Stadium Show",
    "description": "Adorned in a black robe and mask like the high-priest of toxicity — or the R&B Phantom of the Opera — The Weeknd used the third night of his MetLife stadium tour stop for a virtuoso exercise in musical theater. For this edition of his After Hours til Dawn Tour stop, Abel leaned into all his powers of ambiance and mystique while also reminding everyone that, of course, those theatrics are still surpassed by a voice and catalog that have dominated the pop culture landscape since he completely broke into the mainstream about 12 years ago.\nStepping into the building for the action, Okayplayer soaked up all the vibes. Here are our top five moments from the show.\n5. Abel Embodies the Abyss\nWith beams of goldish light streaming down atop a stage set of collapsed buildings, Weeknd’s performance ground looked like the aftermath of a dystopian riot. Amid the grim, yet stylish scenery, Weeknd surfaced. Clad in a creepy black robe with a band of red demon ghouls in the foreground, Abel let loose his ghostly tenor to sing “The Abyss,” with a visual that absolutely looked like it. Haunting, yet futuristic, it was the best kind of aesthetic and sonic symmetry.\n4. Playboi Carti Joins Weeknd for “Rather Lie”\nMaybe an hour-and-a-half after serving up his own fairly electric set, Playboi Carti popped out for to join Weeknd on their best collaboration. The energy between the two was palpable, and Carti’s less linear vocal stylings added a nice sonic contrast to Weeknd’s heavenly hedonism that, obviously, defined the night.\n3. “After Hours” Transitions to “Starboy”\nBesides Weeknd’s vocals, the symbiosis between the visuals and the music was a through line of the whole performance. The opening sequence of songs — so, like the first 12 minutes or so — was more or less the apex of the connection. Particularly from “After Hours” to “Starboy.” As The Weeknd departed the nocturnal disco of the former, the cross-shaped stage lit up with a series of diamond-ish stars as he entered “Starboy” for a micro showcase that evoked the cosmos. Starboy, indeed.\n2. “Is There Someone Else?” Turns Into “Wicked Games,” Then “Call Out My Name”\nI would have preferred the OG “Wicked Games” instrumental, but the celestial light show combined with the ambiance of the “Is There Someone Else” is an elite collision with Weeknd’s reedily powerful voice. And with that folding into “Call Out My Name,” you get an extended trip to the realm of eerie excellence.\n\n1. “Blinding Lights” Is Blindingly Good Live\nThe show was already gradually — and slowly and sexily — approaching an epic crescendo when the fireworks popped off during … you know, “Fireworks.” But when “Blinding Lights” began playing and the stage lights started beaming from every direction, it all reached another level of epicness. On one hand, it was all actually kind of blinding and disorienting; but in a really cool way where you’re pulled into the euphoria of the moment. On the whole, Weeknd proved the ability to pull you into which ever feeling he was emitting at the time — whether it was explosive thrills or cosmic loneliness. The range of emotions and sensations served as portals between your favorite spot to go after hours and the sobering morning isolation after dawn.\n\n\n",

    "title": "Loaded Lux on How He Linked Up With Joey Bada$$ for “My Town”",
    "description": "Toward the back end ofJoey Bada$$ scathing Ray Vaughn and DAYLYT diss track, “My Town,”“My Town,”Loaded Luxembraces the ephemeral thrill of a consolation prize. Stacking a slickPowerreference atop a candle metaphor, Lux brings all his battle rap charisma into the type of surgical DAYLYT put-down he hasn’t yet gotten to spit in person: “When niggas who say they want power, ghost the script/Post the the battle, you don't commit/But what I can do is put it on wax, you know it's lit.” It’s a fiery line amid the most random battle royale I’ve ever seen. It’s a dope moment. But Lux still prefers the live-action shouts and impenetrable mean mugs of the URL and the like.\n“I'm from the arena,” he tells Okayplayer. “When you talking about really getting busy, I feel like that's top shelf when you talking about high level competition in rap. We battle. When you space and that energy and then you at it with somebody, ain’t no higher level,” he adds. “And I’ve been in all the spaces.”\nHis latest trip to the on-wax vacuum began with a series of conversations with Joey, who’s currently in the midst of a chaotic, bi-coastal battle royale. “Me and Joey [already] had a relationship,” Lux shares. “He hit me and when he hit me we was just really at first just going back and forth about how it could go, what it is and everything that was going on and talking about how the situation even arose.”\n- YouTubewww.youtube.com\nSome time after Lux told Joey about his own potentially impending battle with DAYLYT, DAYLYT dropped his Joey diss, “WRD2MIMVA” last Monday. From there, Joey reconnected with Lux for some war room strategy. “[Joey] told me about it after he know what direction he was trying to go, he had a few ideas,\" Lux says. \"Once he let me know what direction he was trying to go in, I think I did my verse the next day.”\nThe result was perhaps the best diss track of this increasingly complicated cross-coast rap battle between Joey, Ray Vaughn, DAYLYT, Az Chike and seemingly 100 others. While there are other strong entries, Joey and Lux flaunt a special N-Y chemistry, with Lux bringing literal decades of live battle experiences to the mix. His years in and outside the booth allow him to effectively translate the visceral energy of live death matches to the confines of an instrumental.\n“I had the luxury of getting my tutelage in the studio close to around the same time that I started really jumping in the arena,” Lux says. “So I had the best of both worlds. I understand how you have to translate from what you do in raw form. It’s allowing the music to hold its space and then you still being able to do what you do. There's a synchronicity that starts to form with that,” he adds. “Once you are aware of it, you coloring in the lines.”\nLux clearly enjoyed the moment, and Joey — and probably everyone else involved — appears to be, too. But DAYLYT is withdrawing from the Bada$ side of things. At the end of his latest diss track, “End Credits,” he gave Joey props for his one-man crusade.\n\"The Ruler's back, oh, you the man, Joey / Today I crown you the King of New York for taking that stand, Joey / You really took the fade with all of us, a brave man / NY-made man, it should say 'Immortal' when your grave land…”\nWhile it’s fun to get jokes off, not every battle has to end the way Kendrick Lamar and Drake’s unfolded. For a true to life battler, DAYLYT’S shoutout is the best case scenario. Evidence that you can live by the pen without having to die by it.\n“Life is a fight,” Lux says, adding a philosophical dimension to the conversation. “[The battles] are friendly fire and it's okay. As long as the competition don't end in casualties, it's a beautiful thing.”",

    "title": "A Brief History of the Predatory Record Deal",
    "description": "Additional reporting by Meka Udoh.\nOn“Check the Rhyme”from A Tribe Called Quest’s 1991 vanguardThe Low End Theory,Q-Tipmemorably quipped,“Industry Rule No. 4080: Record company people are shady.”There are legions of artists who would agree with the sentiments of The Abstract, who have encountered the evils of such economic exploitation.\nThe record business has (allegedly) scammed countless musicians out of their masters, publishing rights, royalties, and just about everything else under the sun. Artists who lacked the proper knowledge and/or — more importantly — legal representation would be taken advantage of by labels and publishers with complex contracts.\nWhile America was caught in the wave that was rock and roll music in the ‘50s, Black musicians were unsurprisingly gate-kept from and exploited by labels all too eager to profit off their blood, sweat, and melodies. Chuck Berry, widely regarded as the founding father of the genre, launched his career with his iconic tune “Maybelline” on Chess Records. However, Alan Freed (a radio disc jockey credited with actually popularizing the term “rock and roll”) and Russ Fratto (the landlord of Chess Records, the label Berry was signed to) werecredited as the song’s co-writers, giving them a share of the royalties. For decades, Berry persistently fought a legal battle to reclaim ownership of his work, and in 1986, his efforts were finally recognized when he was officially awarded full credit for the song.Little Richard's masterpiece lined other pocketsSimilarly, in 1956, Little Richardsold the publishing rights to his classic \"Tutti Frutti\"to Specialty Records owner Art Rupe for a mere $50. Additionally, his contract would only pay himless than one centfor each record sold, significantly less than the standard 3-5 percent rate that artists received. While the 1955 classic \"Tutti Frutti” would go on to sell over 500,000 copies, Little Richardwould only receive $25,000from those sales. To add insult to injury, Richard would not receive royalties even when his music was covered by other artists, notably Pat Boonein 1956. In 1984, Little Richard filed a $112 million lawsuit against Specialty Records, claiming he hadn’t received royalties since leaving the label in 1959. He eventually settled out of court for an undisclosed amount, and later, after Michael Jackson purchased ATV in 1985, which, among with The Beatles, owned the rights to Little Richard’s publishing — Jackson returned those rights to him.Prince and Michael Jackson missed out on millionsPrince performs on stage wearing 'Slave' tattoo, on 'The Ultimate Live Experience' tour at Wembley Arena on March 4th, 1995 in London, United Kingdom.Photo by Pete Still/Redferns.PrinceandMichael Jacksonwere two of the most critically acclaimed and commercially successful artists of all time. Yet both legends were forced to fight their labels over contracts that exploited their talents and denied them a fair share of the profits from their work.Prince endured a four-decade battle with Warner Music, all stemming from when he signed his first deal in 1977 at the naive age of 18. Following the massive success he experienced in the 1980s, The Purple One would ink a $100 million deal with the label in 1991, which at the time was considered the biggest recording contract in history. But things soured quickly, as Prince felt that under the deal with Warner, they owned and controlled his name as well as any music released under that name. As a result, Prince would change his name to an unpronounceable emblem (called the “Love Symbol”) and would be referred to as “The Artist Formerly Known As Prince,” and during live appearances and performances wrote “Slave” on his face in protest. To get out of the deal, Prince would have to fulfill his contractual obligations with several album releases between 1995 and 1996:The Gold Experience,Chaos and Disorder,Emancipation, and the soundtrack to the filmGirl 6. Once freed from his deal, Prince became a vocal advocate for artists' rights, subsequently opting for distribution deals with labels rather than traditional record contracts until his passing in 2016.Following his legendary run from 1979’s Off the Wall to 1995’sHIStory: Past, Present and Future(released via Epic Records, a Sony label), Jackson grew increasingly critical of the label and its then-CEO Tommy Mottola, accusing him of “racist” and “manipulative” business practices after what he felt was the mishandling of his 2001 albumInvincible. He also expressed frustration over the release of the compilation albumNumber Onesin 2003. In a twist of irony, in 2016 Sony acquired the Jackson estate’s remaining 50 percent stake in Sony/ATV for $750 million, securing full ownership of the publishing catalog, after previously purchasing half of Jackson’s own music catalog for a reported $600 million.Jackson would pass away in 2009, at the age of 50.De La Soul's years of missed streaming revenueDe La Soul arrive at the 2004 MTV Video Music Awards at the American Airlines Arena August 29, 2004 in Miami, Florida.Photo by Frank Micelotta/Getty Images.De La Soulis a cautionary tale for how a shoddy record deal can have a devastating impact in the streaming era.For years, the Native Tongues trio was embroiled in a complicated contractual dispute over sample clearances with their label Tommy Boy Records when they sued forcopyright infringement. After Tommy Boy reacquired the rights to their first six albums from Warner Bros., the group alleged that label founder and CEO Tom Silverman offered them a 90/10 profit split ahead of plans to bring their music to streaming platforms in 2019. The long shadow of their early contracts meant the group missed out on years of streaming revenue, as their music remained absent from digital platforms and ownership of their master recordings remained out of reach. While De La Soul was able toreach a dealwith Reservoir Records to release their music and finally own their masters David Jude Jolicoeur — also known as Trugoy the Dove, Plug Two, or just Dave — would pass away in 2023, mere weeks before their full catalog officially hit streaming platforms.Clipse slips from bad label deal to bad label dealFor Non-Editorial use please seek approval from Fashion House) No Malice and Pusha T of Clipse attend the Louis Vuitton Menswear Spring/Summer 2025 show as part of Paris Fashion Week on June 18, 2024 in Paris, France.Photo by Julien M. Hekimian/Getty Images.Pusha T and Malice, better known as Clipse, have endured more false starts than a deaf track-and-field runner, thanks largely to label issues. After their original debut album,Exclusive Audio Footage, was shelved in 1999, they finally released their official debut,Lord Willin’, in 2002 through the Neptunes’ Star Trak Entertainment, under Arista Records. A label restructuring in 2004 shifted Clipse to Jive Records, while Star Trak moved under Interscope, effectively trapping the Thornton brothers in a music industry Phantom Zone. Four years afterLord Willin’— and following two critically acclaimedWe Got It 4 Cheapmixtapes — Clipse sued Jive and eventually negotiated a deal to release their long-delayed sophomore album,Hell Hath No Fury, through their own Re-Up Gang Records imprint in 2006. In 2007, they parted ways with Jive, signing a new deal with Columbia Records.Though Pusha T’s erstwhile rivalLil Waynehas been tied to Cash Money Records since his teenage years, he too has found himself entangled in the predatory practices of the music industry. In 2015, he sued Cash Money for a whopping $51 million, citing their refusal to release his albumTha Carter V, unpaid royalties, and control of his Young Money Entertainment (at that time the home to Drake and Nicki Minaj).

In 2018, Megan signed with former baseball star Carl Crawford’s imprint, reportedly receiving a modest $10,000 advance — a figure considered well below industry standards. She later claimed the deal was a \"360 agreement,\" allowing the label to collect a share of her earnings beyond album sales, including revenue from live performances and merchandise. Tensions escalated when Megan sued 1501 Certified Entertainment, after the label disputed whether her 2021 releaseSomething for Thee Hottiesqualified as an official album under her contract. Meanwhile, the label’s actions reportedly stalled the release of her new music. After a years-long court battle, Megan and 1501agreed to a settlementin 2023, with Megan a few months later reaching a distribution deal with Warner Music to release music through her own imprint, Hot Girl Productions, while retaining complete ownership of her masters and publishing rights.Bad record deals seem more common than notThe members of N'Sync arrive at the 43rd Annual Grammy Awards at Staples Center in Los Angeles, CA on February 21, 2001.Photo by Frank Micelotta/Getty Images.Across genres, exploitative contracts have ensnared some of music’s most iconic talents — many of whom may have remained unheard if not for their own outcry and the intervention of key industry power players. Before coming to prominence, Van Morrison found himself stuck in a record deal thatnearly derailed his burgeoning career.Billy Joel’sten-album deal with Family Productions in 1971was so deplorable that — thanks to signing away his publishing and recording rights — his debut albumCold Spring Harborwas marred by a mastering mistake that altered its sound, while Joel remained powerless to do anything until the late record executive Walter Yentikoff purchased his publishing rights and returned them to him. Taylor Swift famously released her “Taylor’s Version” re-recordings after her former label sold the masters of her first six albums to Scooter Braun for a reported $300 million. In 1999, *NSYNC sued both their former label, Trans Continental Records (later RCA Records), and manager Lou Pearlman for fraud and misrepresentation. Kesha was caught ina nearly decade-long legal war with her record label, Kemosabe Records, and Dr. Luke, the owner of the label, over her six-album contract. Kesha would also accuse Luke of sexual, physical, and emotional abuse. Both parties settled in 2023.As long as there are talented artists, there will always be those who will try to exploit their gifts for financial gain. In today’s music climate, artists are more than aware of the pitfalls of artist-unfriendly contracts and have more entrepreneurial opportunities than the previous generation of musicians. Despite this, however, powerful record labels and music corporationsstill have the meansto finesse artists out of their artistic livelihoods. When considering the record industry’s long track record of exploiting artists, the words of Prince remain true: “If you don’t own your masters,” Princesaid in 1996, “your master owns you.”\nWhile America was caught in the wave that was rock and roll music in the ‘50s, Black musicians were unsurprisingly gate-kept from and exploited by labels all too eager to profit off their blood, sweat, and melodies. Chuck Berry, widely regarded as the founding father of the genre, launched his career with his iconic tune “Maybelline” on Chess Records. However, Alan Freed (a radio disc jockey credited with actually popularizing the term “rock and roll”) and Russ Fratto (the landlord of Chess Records, the label Berry was signed to) werecredited as the song’s co-writers, giving them a share of the royalties. For decades, Berry persistently fought a legal battle to reclaim ownership of his work, and in 1986, his efforts were finally recognized when he was officially awarded full credit for the song.\nSimilarly, in 1956, Little Richardsold the publishing rights to his classic \"Tutti Frutti\"to Specialty Records owner Art Rupe for a mere $50. Additionally, his contract would only pay himless than one centfor each record sold, significantly less than the standard 3-5 percent rate that artists received. While the 1955 classic \"Tutti Frutti” would go on to sell over 500,000 copies, Little Richardwould only receive $25,000from those sales. To add insult to injury, Richard would not receive royalties even when his music was covered by other artists, notably Pat Boonein 1956. In 1984, Little Richard filed a $112 million lawsuit against Specialty Records, claiming he hadn’t received royalties since leaving the label in 1959. He eventually settled out of court for an undisclosed amount, and later, after Michael Jackson purchased ATV in 1985, which, among with The Beatles, owned the rights to Little Richard’s publishing — Jackson returned those rights to him.\nPrince performs on stage wearing 'Slave' tattoo, on 'The Ultimate Live Experience' tour at Wembley Arena on March 4th, 1995 in London, United Kingdom.\nPhoto by Pete Still/Redferns.\nPrinceandMichael Jacksonwere two of the most critically acclaimed and commercially successful artists of all time. Yet both legends were forced to fight their labels over contracts that exploited their talents and denied them a fair share of the profits from their work.\nPrince endured a four-decade battle with Warner Music, all stemming from when he signed his first deal in 1977 at the naive age of 18. Following the massive success he experienced in the 1980s, The Purple One would ink a $100 million deal with the label in 1991, which at the time was considered the biggest recording contract in history. But things soured quickly, as Prince felt that under the deal with Warner, they owned and controlled his name as well as any music released under that name. As a result, Prince would change his name to an unpronounceable emblem (called the “Love Symbol”) and would be referred to as “The Artist Formerly Known As Prince,” and during live appearances and performances wrote “Slave” on his face in protest. To get out of the deal, Prince would have to fulfill his contractual obligations with several album releases between 1995 and 1996:The Gold Experience,Chaos and Disorder,Emancipation, and the soundtrack to the filmGirl 6. Once freed from his deal, Prince became a vocal advocate for artists' rights, subsequently opting for distribution deals with labels rather than traditional record contracts until his passing in 2016.\nFollowing his legendary run from 1979’s Off the Wall to 1995’sHIStory: Past, Present and Future(released via Epic Records, a Sony label), Jackson grew increasingly critical of the label and its then-CEO Tommy Mottola, accusing him of “racist” and “manipulative” business practices after what he felt was the mishandling of his 2001 albumInvincible. He also expressed frustration over the release of the compilation albumNumber Onesin 2003. In a twist of irony, in 2016 Sony acquired the Jackson estate’s remaining 50 percent stake in Sony/ATV for $750 million, securing full ownership of the publishing catalog, after previously purchasing half of Jackson’s own music catalog for a reported $600 million.\nJackson would pass away in 2009, at the age of 50.\nDe La Soul arrive at the 2004 MTV Video Music Awards at the American Airlines Arena August 29, 2004 in Miami, Florida.\nPhoto by Frank Micelotta/Getty Images.\nDe La Soulis a cautionary tale for how a shoddy record deal can have a devastating impact in the streaming era.For years, the Native Tongues trio was embroiled in a complicated contractual dispute over sample clearances with their label Tommy Boy Records when they sued forcopyright infringement. After Tommy Boy reacquired the rights to their first six albums from Warner Bros., the group alleged that label founder and CEO Tom Silverman offered them a 90/10 profit split ahead of plans to bring their music to streaming platforms in 2019. The long shadow of their early contracts meant the group missed out on years of streaming revenue, as their music remained absent from digital platforms and ownership of their master recordings remained out of reach. While De La Soul was able toreach a dealwith Reservoir Records to release their music and finally own their masters David Jude Jolicoeur — also known as Trugoy the Dove, Plug Two, or just Dave — would pass away in 2023, mere weeks before their full catalog officially hit streaming platforms.\nFor Non-Editorial use please seek approval from Fashion House) No Malice and Pusha T of Clipse attend the Louis Vuitton Menswear Spring/Summer 2025 show as part of Paris Fashion Week on June 18, 2024 in Paris, France.\nPhoto by Julien M. Hekimian/Getty Images.\nPusha T and Malice, better known as Clipse, have endured more false starts than a deaf track-and-field runner, thanks largely to label issues. After their original debut album,Exclusive Audio Footage, was shelved in 1999, they finally released their official debut,Lord Willin’, in 2002 through the Neptunes’ Star Trak Entertainment, under Arista Records. A label restructuring in 2004 shifted Clipse to Jive Records, while Star Trak moved under Interscope, effectively trapping the Thornton brothers in a music industry Phantom Zone. Four years afterLord Willin’— and following two critically acclaimedWe Got It 4 Cheapmixtapes — Clipse sued Jive and eventually negotiated a deal to release their long-delayed sophomore album,Hell Hath No Fury, through their own Re-Up Gang Records imprint in 2006. In 2007, they parted ways with Jive, signing a new deal with Columbia Records.\nThough Pusha T’s erstwhile rivalLil Waynehas been tied to Cash Money Records since his teenage years, he too has found himself entangled in the predatory practices of the music industry. In 2015, he sued Cash Money for a whopping $51 million, citing their refusal to release his albumTha Carter V, unpaid royalties, and control of his Young Money Entertainment (at that time the home to Drake and Nicki Minaj). Eventually, Wayne and Birdmanwould come to an agreement, andThe Carter Vwas finally released in 2018, seven years after its predecessor.\nMegan Thee Stallion performs at Coachella Stage during the 2025 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival on April 20, 2025 in Indio, California.\nPhoto by Arturo Holmes/Getty Images for Coachella.\nThe issues betweenMegan Thee Stallionand her former label, 1501 Certified Entertainment,are well-documented.

    "description": "If you’re anything like me, you’re picky about what you watch. I steer clear of anything that doesn’t deepen my understanding of the world in some way. My watch list is full of documentaries spanning history, murder cases, nature, culture, and white failure (FYRE: The Greatest Party That Never Happenedis my comfort movie).\nBut over the last few years, my close friends and I have collectively obsessed over shows likeLove Is Blind,The Ultimatum, and most recently,Love IslandUSA.\nFor the uninitiated,Love Islandstrands a villa full of twenty-somethings in swimwear, dares them to couple up, and lets viewers vote on who pockets a six-figure prize. ThinkThe Real Worldbut with soft porn. The show is anything but intellectually stimulating, and yet my friends and I — a mix of lawyers, artists, and educators — gather in living rooms and group chats to dissect every absurd twist almost daily. And we’re not alone.The show originally aired in the U.K. in 2015 and has since produced nearly 500 episodes and spin-offs in more than 20 countries. In just the first six days of the current season’s debut on June 6, the showshattered Peacock’s streaming record, with 1.2 billion minutes watched. Want to catch up? There are more than 1 million videos under the hashtag#LoveIsland on TikTokalone. From memes to recaps to couple predictions, it’s clear a full-blown community has formed around this ridiculous show. But why? Certainly not for the intellectual takeaways on the complexity of love and gender dynamics. But the answer might blow your mind.Apaper from the University at Buffaloon “social embeddedness” found that shared media experiences flood us with dopamine, oxytocin, and endorphins, the chemical cocktail behind bonding and collective euphoria. When we feel connected and included, our brains reward us with a rush of positive chemicals that satisfy a basic survival need. A 2019 review by Redcay and Schilbach found thatco-experienced media, even virtually, activates the systems in our brain that are critical to empathy and social bonding.It’s the same rush you get watching fireworks on Juneteenth or your favorite team score the winning touchdown. When you experience those things with other people, you feel like you’re part of something bigger. And in a world that feels more baffling by the day, even a little reminder that you’re not alone can be a breath of fresh air.So, if you’re asLove Island-obsessed as I am but feel a tinge of shame that Amaya Papaya’s one-liners and Nic’s “mamacita” live rent-free in your mind, take comfort. You’re not rotting your brain, wasting your time, or littering the timeline; you’re contributing to the perpetuation of mankind and bettering brains one unhinged observation at a time.

    "title": "Black Men Share How They Cope With Feeling Overwhelmed",
    "description": "These days, it doesn’t take much to feel stretched thin, especially for Black men. A scroll through the headlines or social media can spike stress levels fast. And while the world keeps spinning, the emotional load doesn’t always get a chance to be unpacked. For women, the weight ofunpaid domestic laborand emotional caretaking often creates an imbalance. But surprisingly, they also tend to have stronger coping strategies.\nWomen are more likely to lean on their communities, talk it out, and seek comfort through connection. Men, meanwhile, are often conditioned to hold it in. A 2021 study fromHim & Hersrevealed that over 80% of men reported moderate to extreme stress. But the question remains: how are they dealing with it?\nThat silence has real consequences, not just for men’s health but for the people around them. So I asked the question directly: “How do you deal with overwhelm?”\nHere’s how a few Black men say they manage when life feels like too much:\n“I try to breathe and pick a direction, because overwhelm feels like being pulled in different directions at once, which looks on the outside like I’m frozen.”\n—Justin, 35, Program Manager\n“I'm really trying to not self-isolate when I feel overwhelm. Been practicing breathing, connecting with folks who feel like home, hugs go really far, so does a joint.”\n—Rashid, 41, Artist\n“Go for a walk or to the movies. Talk to my wife. Zone out playing video games. I try to fight against being silent and shutting down.”\n—Reginald, 40, Photographer\n“I disconnect and do things good for my body, my mind and my spirit. That could look like go to my fave gym, eat my favorite meal, watch a new movie and spend time talking shit with my favorite people.”\n—Chernoh, 34, filmmaker\n“When I feel overwhelmed, I do some rigorous exercise. Call a bad b**ch to join me for a puff and a laugh. Get right to micro-tasking progress. Not in that particular order.”\n—Anwar, 41, Video Game Artist\n“I meditate. Nothing too long, maybe 3-5 minutes just to block out the noise that overwhelmed me. Then, I make sure to remind myself that I’ve survived every bad day that’s come before this and this period will be no different.”\n—Tareq, 41, Brand Director\n“Slowing down by breathing and being still in the moment works MFing wonders for me. The more calm I get the better decisions I can make.”\n—Pope, 49, Designer and Artist\nThese responses don’t just challenge the old trope of men suffering in silence—they remind us that men's mental health doesn’t exist in a vacuum. It affects their partners, families, and the communities they move through. So while the sources of stress and the ways folks cope might look different, one thing’s clear: healthier men mean stronger relationships and more balanced communities.\nIf you haven’t asked the men in your life what’s weighing on their chest—or how they’re really dealing with it—this is a good time to start. A real conversation can go a long way.",

    "description": "The Soulquarians collective is one of the most revered in Black music and one of the most important crews that have ever come together inanymusical discipline. Comprised of legendary artists likeErykah Badu,D’Angelo, the lateRoy Hargrove,Q-Tip,Common, The Roots, Bilal and the legendary J Dilla, the Soulquarians helped shape neo-soul while also carrying the torch for alternative hip-hop crews like Native Tongues. In the late 1990s, they changed the landscape of urban music with songs and albums that were as spiritual as they were soulful; music that could be personal but with universal reach.\nFor this Wellness Wednesday, here are 10 Soulquarian tracks to help you find serenity when you need it most. If your world is getting heavy, light a candle, say a mantra and put on some tracks from this legendary crew to get yourself balanced. Tap in below.\n\n“LIQUID STREETS” - ROY HARGROVE\n- YouTubewww.youtube.com\nA mid-tempo tune that sounds like strolling through Harlem after a great date night, this smooth track from The RH Project’s 2003 album,Hard Groove,showcases the effortless musicality of the late trumpeter and his band–in particular; the smooth acoustic bass of Reggie Washington and James Poyser’s keys make it easy to get lost in the soul.\n“GIRL BLUE” - Q-TIP\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55VGa7TzDOA\nA cut from the A Tribe Called Quest frontman’s controversial second solo album, this jazzy track is ultra-smooth — smooth enough to almost make you forget it’s addressing bumpy themes like self-awareness and depression.The narrator sounds like he loves this woman–but he’s also concerned about why she happens to be so…blue.\n“ORANGE MOON” - ERYKAH BADU\n- YouTubewww.youtube.com\nIt opens with the sound of crickets chirping–as Badu’s cool vocal eases in over Shaun Martin keys. The song blossoms into one of Badu’s most perfect soul-jazz amalgamations; a swaying slice of sublime musicality. Perfect rainy day music—or for any time that you just want to get lost in a vibe. How good it is.\n“ALL MATTER” - BILAL\n- YouTubewww.youtube.com\nBilal has always been unafraid of exploring themes of inner turmoil and existential awareness. What is love? Cool on the outside–hot in the middle. The singer-songwriter offers a rumination on love and spirit with this track from 2010sAirtight’s Revenge.\n“DIME PIECE” - J. DILLA, DWELE\n- YouTubewww.youtube.com\nDilla was always the spiritual core of the Soulquarians, and the legendary Detroit producer’s sound is the connective tissue between this collective of artists. Needless to say, his own catalog is legendary; and this track fromThe Shiningboasts a ghostly Dwele vocal and an ethereal, only-Dilla-could-create this production.\n“NAG CHAMPA (AFRODISIAC FOR THE WORLD)” - COMMON\n- YouTubewww.youtube.com\nOne of the breeziest tracks on the Chicago rapper’s most acclaimed albums, it’s an indicator that Common’s reputation as the thoughtful emcee is well-earned. Some regrettable homophobia aside, it’s one of his best tracks. WIth a perfect J Dilla hook, to boot.\n“ONE SHINE” - THE ROOTS, CASSANDRA WILSON, AMEL LARRIEUX\n- YouTubewww.youtube.com\nOn their stellar third album, the legendary crew from Philadelphia expanded on the promise they’d shown onDo You Want More?!!!??!with a bit more polish and craft. And a standout moment onIlladelph Halflifeis this cerebral instrumental–complete with scatting vocals from two of neo-soul’s most underrated vocalists.\n“SEND IT ON” - D’ANGEL\n- YouTubewww.youtube.com\nIt’s a highwater mark for the man, theVoodooalbum, and for every musician involved. It feels so intimate, so lived-in and justsosoulful. Pino Palladino provides that gorgeously elegant bassline–with the Hargrove’s horns taking things to a heavenly place. While also providing a lyric that seems to encourage you to keep pushing through and holding on to love.\n“MAKE MY” - THE ROOTS, BIG K.R.I.T., DICE RAW\n- YouTubewww.youtube.com\nThe Roots’ ambitious concept albumunduntells the tragic story of fictional Redford Stevens, and on this emotional midtempo cut, Dice Raw and Big K.R.I.T give voice to the man’s suicidal thoughts and pain. It’s not depressing, however–but it is undeniably moving. Evocative without trying too hard.\n“UMI SAYS’ - MOS DEF\n- YouTubewww.youtube.com\nOne of the emcee’s most beloved songs, this classicBlack On Both Sidestrack is mesmerizing and majestic. Part mantra, part prayer, it’s a song that illustrates Yasiin Bey’s ability to connect human struggle to something godly and elevated. A rallying cry for Black folks that sound like victory is closer than we can imagine.",

    "description": "WhenMichelene Augustefirst arrived in New York ten years ago by way of Trinidad and Tobago—after modeling in London and Paris—she didn’t plan on openinga vintage shop. But after bouncing between boroughs and collecting pieces that felt like home, she turned a pop-up into a vibrant storefront.\nStudio Dem, nowthree years deepin Williamsburg, is more than a place to cop a look. It’s a cultural touchpoint connecting shoppers to Auguste’s Caribbean heritage and style wisdom honed through generations of matriarchs.\nPhoto courtesy of Studio Dem.Michelene’s love for fashion goes way back to childhood, when she’d watch her mother and aunties get ready to leave the house. She also credits her grandmother, Dr. Molly Ahye, a dancer, orisha priestess, and cultural activist, with shaping her appreciation for garments as storytelling. “I wanted it to feel Caribbean,” Michelene says. “And I wanted to create a space for Caribbean artists and designers.”That intention of Studio Dem is felt the moment you step through the door. “It’s like a museum of all our trinkets and art and pieces,” she explains. Painted flags, rich textures, and vibrant prints make the shop feel like a breakaway from the luxury familiars that now line the streets of Williamsburg.Before opening her shop, Michelene sold vintage online, but quickly realized New York’s energy called for something more tactile. “With vintage, you kind of want to try things on,” she says. Her first Lower East Side pop-up turned into something real when people started showing up and staying. “I made the space feel like home and people loved it.”Michelene is intentional about taking up space — even if it ruffles feathers. “We had a steel pan guy outside and neighbors called the police,” she recalls. “But the cops were like, ‘You’re not doing anything wrong.’” In a rapidly gentrifying neighborhood, her shop stands as a source of joy and resistance, and harkens back to a time when the historically Puerto Rican neighborhood had fewer luxury shops and more brown skin.Dem is also expanding its vibe. Now, patrons can grab a coffee, take a seat, and linger, and Michelene sends an open call to collaborate with other Black and brown creatives. “I want the space to feel like a community experience,” she says.In a city sometimes unrecognizable by long-time residents, Studio Dem reminds shoppers, admirers, and passersby that New York would be nothing without its diasporic roots.Photo courtesy of Studio Dem.\nPhoto courtesy of Studio Dem.\nMichelene’s love for fashion goes way back to childhood, when she’d watch her mother and aunties get ready to leave the house.

    "title": "How to Be Outside, Inside featuring Bub Styles",
    "description": "Brooklyn nativeBub Styleshas been steadily earning his place in the city's rap lineage, drawing attention from platforms like Hot 97 and Shade45 while carving out his own sound. His music leans heavy and raw, and so does his version of New York.\nIn addition to propelling his own music, he’s also been influential in creating a vibrant platform for showcasing emerging underground rappers. It’s called Chinatown Sound, and along with his co-founder Gee, they’ve profiled some of the sharpest lesser-known wordsmiths in the game.\nFor Bub Styles, dodging the transplants and embracing the city’s rich diversity is how he likes to get down. Here’s a glimpse into NYC through his unique lens.\nOkayplayer: When you want to be “outside” without really being outside, where do you go in NYC?\nBub Styles:There’s nothing I love more than being OUTSIDE, but INDOORS—especially for a hot summer like the city is seeing right now. My fat a** is way too rotund for all that sticky humidity bulls**t in these streets. A lot of the spots I always loved to pop out at either closed down or became overrun by bozos with slim boots and funny glasses, but there’s still a few spots I go to catch the jiggyness I seek.\nMight slide through Bed-Stuy and hitTurtles All The Way DownorBunton’s World Famousto check what DJs or bartenders gonna get faded with me when I’m looking fly and feeling like shit.\nMight slide to Williamsburg and check my peoples atPlease Tell MeorQuarter Clubif there’s not too many Connecticut license plates parked out front. Or maybeUnion Poolif the homie is DJing, but ONLY if the homies DJing, ‘cause I’m staying on stage and out the mix of the NYU brigade down below.\nOn occasion I’ll hit my old stomping grounds in the Lower East Side and check what Ludlow and Orchard looking like, but that shit isn’t what it used to be so I might just take my ass back across the bridge.\nPhoto Credit: Paul Gallagher (@gee.cts)\nWhere do you go when you want to be around people, but not overwhelmed by people?\nThat s**t is kind of rare in the city nowadays but we do what we can out here. If I’m out in Chinatown in the daytime —which is often, coordinatingChinatown Soundepisodes— I might check my peoples atCafe Colmadoand politic over iced lattes and shit. I always run into somebody I know over there, shit is definitely a new staple of the neighborhood.\nThen I might go across the street toSpicy Villageor down the block toDeluxe Green Boand eat piles of delicious MSG for like twenty bucks, tops. Might have to pop out to Queens, like Jackson Heights or Astoria or some shit and get worldly wit it. If I’m at some Indian or Himalayan or Ecuadorian or Malaysian joint out there, even if it’s packed, it’s all foreigners, so I feel wild anonymous in those parts. For some, that might be overwhelming, but I find peace in the chaos sometimes.\nWhat does your perfect NYC day look like, from morning to night?\nI'm waking up early afternoon from debauchery the night before. If it’s the perfect day, my phone isn’t overloaded with bulls**t I have to address from labels, artists, family or homie drama, so can just stretch and take a s**t in peace. I’m gonna go get my haircut from the local Dominicans, take a shot of Brugal, and probably pay way too much for an iced horchata shaken espresso from Starbucks. Shower up, hit the studio for a couple hours with an assortment of deli meats and expensive waters. Knock out a joint for myself and ideally 2 or 3 paid features —gimme that $.\nAfter that, maybe if some of the homies are having a food or clothing pop-up, I’ll slide to that. Stuff my face, say “cheers” a few times, and be on my way. Then I’ll probably link some of the bros, laugh at each other’s fashion sense (out of love) and see who knows some s**t popping off. Then go to said s**t-popping-off, maybe 2 or 3 spots around the way, give hugs and high fives, get faded, have sex and take my ass to sleep.",

Back in 2019, we realised that wherever we went, particularly outside of Africa, we saw spirits representing other regions, apart from our own continent. And then in Africa we were importing brands from other parts of the world rather than drinking products made at home. So we decided to change that, by creating vodka, gin, agave and whisky, made in Africa, using African ingredients, by Africans, for the world to enjoy.What are your signature offerings and can you describe the African connections and ingredients in each of them?We have created four brands in different spirits categories, Bayab Gin, Vusa Vodka, Sango Agave and Mansas Whisky, that all have African ingredients and provenance at their core. Bayab’s hero botanical is the baobab fruit from the famous African baobab tree, sourced from Ghana. Did you know that agave, the plant used to make tequila, also grows in Africa? We use that plant that grows in South Africa to create Sango Agave, we use local sugarcane to produce our vodka, and in our whisky, we have the incredible African grain, sorghum which makes our whisky truly African. We produce all of our products in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.How important is it for your brand to authentically speak to African Culture, and how does this residency at Park Lane Hotel in NYC speak to that?It’s critical. We’ve built our brands to celebrate Africa in a way that’s modern, premium, and true to the continent’s creativity and culture, not a cliché version of it. This residency at Park Lane Hotel gives us a platform to bring African spirits, flavors, and culture into one of the world’s most iconic cities and share our vibrancy in the places where our culture belongs. It’s about showing that African brands can lead on any stage, with authenticity and style.What can attendees expect from these Spearhead gatherings going down at Darling Rooftop this summer?Expect amazing energy. The vibes. Afrobeats, Afro House, amapiano, the best of our music today, and our cocktails too. We’re bringing modern African cocktail culture to the best rooftop in New York, with the best view of the city. The skyline hits different from up here, you’ll see.

    "description": "\"Akon City\" was first announced back in 2018. It was pitched as a futuristic, crypto-powered city dreamt up by the performer and likened to a âreal-life Wakanda.â 550 hectares of land near the coastal village of Mbodiene were set aside for the project. Earlier this month, however, fans got a disappointing update. According to the North Africa Post, the Senegalese government has decided to abandon the proposal and reclaim the land. Reportedly, this is due to delays and financial problems. Sapco-Senegal, a state-owned entity that develops coastal and tourism areas, is expected to start working on new hotels, apartments, a marina, and more in the area instead. Despite these reports, Akon insists that \"Akon City\" is still underway, although there are some haters who want to see it fail. TMZ caught up with him in New York City this week, where he claimed that the project is \"under attack.\" \"The impact that it's gonna do for Africa is kind of shaking up a lot of agendas,\" he said. \"So you're gonna see a lot of misinformation on the internet, and I would advise that it's untrue.\" Read More: Senegal Officially Abandons Akon's Futuristic City Proposal  \"For the most part, the project is a city, so it's not gonna stop,\" he continued. \"When you're doing something that big in Africa, specifically with all these agendas tied to it, they're gonna try to discredit it for it not to happen. I just need people to be more wise and know that a project like this don't happen overnight.\" For now, it remains unclear exactly if or when Akon City will be finished. In 2025, Akon spoke with AllHipHop's Chuck Creekmur about Akon City, admitting that he could have done a better job with it early on. \"My biggest thing was I promoted it way, way, way too early,â he explained at the time. \"Of course, anything that exciting that would change a culture, people will naturally want to know whatâs happening right now, assuming that itâs already happening. But it was in a process of creating.\" Read More: Akon's Wife Files Lawsuit Against Publix Supermarket Over Male Employee Violating Her In 2022",

    "description": "The Air Jordan 11 Low âMotherâs Dayâ drops in the summer 2026, landing just ahead of the holiday with a colorway thatâs both striking and sentimental. Jordan Brand is using this release to highlight motherhood through one of its most iconic silhouettes. With its roots in MJâs legendary 1995â96 season, the Air Jordan 11 is often seen as a symbol of greatness and grace, making it the perfect model to honor the strength and style of moms. The shoe pairs a bright white mesh upper with glossy metallic gold patent leather, creating a clean, regal look. Photos show an icy translucent sole and gold accents, including a heart-shaped âMy Heartâ tag that dials up the emotional edge. Itâs flashy, but tasteful, like a trophy in sneaker form. The Air Jordan 11 Low has always brought elegance to the hardwood. While MJ never wore this specific model in a game, itâs become a go-to favorite for spring and summer. With this new twist, itâs stepping into more heartfelt territory. Read More: First Look At The Air Jordan 15 23RE âBlack Muslinâ  The Air Jordan 11 Low âMotherâs Dayâ features a white mesh upper paired with a metallic gold patent leather mudguard that wraps the entire shoe. Gold Jumpman branding sits on the tongue, while white laces and midsole keep things crisp. Also, a translucent outsole adds a frosty finish. Further, the most unique detail is a gold heart-shaped charm reading âMy Heart,â hanging off the laces as a tribute piece. The inner lining stays simple in white, allowing the shine to take center stage. Itâs a clean, bold take on a classic model with personal storytelling stitched into every piece. House Of Heat reports that the Air Jordan 11 Low âMotherâs Dayâ will be released on May 10th, 2026. Also, the retail price of the sneakers will be $195 when they drop.

    "description": "The Air Jordan 3 OG \"Bin 23\" is making a rare debut in the summer of 2026. First introduced in 2010, this colorway was part of the original Bin 23 series, a collection that leaned into the idea of sneakers as high art. Each pair was individually numbered, built with premium materials, and inspired by the care and quality of winemaking. Now, Jordan Brand is reviving the Bin 23 label with this \"Team Red\" Air Jordan 3, draped in luxurious tones of burgundy, gold, and coconut milk. The comeback also brings back the OG \"Nike Air\" branding on the heel, a touch thatâs always appreciated by longtime fans. This isn't just another retro. Itâs a symbol of storytelling, craftsmanship, and restraint. With only 2,300 pairs being produced worldwide, the exclusivity echoes the intent of the original drop. Looking at the photos, the bold colors and elevated materials speak for themselves. The silhouette remains one of Tinker Hatfieldâs best designs, a mid-top that helped define the early 90s and reestablish Michael Jordanâs Nike legacy after a contract scare. This time around, itâs not about hype, itâs about legacy. Read More: First Look At The Air Jordan 3 OG âWorldâs Best Dadâ  This Air Jordan 3 comes wrapped in a mix of team red and burgundy crush. Premium suede and leather cover the upper, while gold eyelets and heel branding add contrast. The midsole pops in coconut nilk, and the classic elephant print gets a tonal makeover. Also, a darker red lines the collar, giving depth to the upper. The âNike Airâ heel tab returns, finished in metallic gold. Further underfoot, a burgundy outsole seals the deal. Each pair is individually numbered, just like the original Bin 23 release. House Of Heat reports that the Air Jordan 3 OG âBin 23â will be released on June 13th, 2026. Also, the retail price of the sneakers will be $350 when they drop. Read More: Air Jordan 5 OG âWhite Metallicâ Brings Back A Fan Favorite",

    "description": "Fyre Festival creator Billy McFarland previously announced his intentions to sell the controversial intellectual property. After being unable to find a buyer, he posted it on eBay. The move attracted some bidders, and on July 15, the auction officially closed. The winner of Fyre Fest will pay $245,300 to McFarland for the IP. McFarland streamed the closing moments of the auction, and he appeared visibly disappointed by the final bids. \"Damn, this sucks. It's so low,\" he said after the bidding crossed $240,000. Shortly after, he published a press release that seemed less pessimistic than his original response. âI would like to congratulate the winning bidder in the FYRE Festival IP auction on eBay. I look forward to working with them to begin the process to finalize the sale. FYRE Festival is just one chapter of my story, and lâm excited to move onto my next one,\" reads part of Billy McFarland's statement, which he published to Instagram shortly after the auction closed. Read More: Ja Rule & The Fyre Festival Scam  Of course, fans will remember the first Fyre Festival for all the wrong reasons. In 2017, Billy McFarland (with help from Ja Rule) attempted to host a Coachella-like music festival in The Bahamas. It was a disaster, with poor accommodations for attendees and the 33 advertised artists pulling out due to poor planning. McFarland and his associates were investigated for several forms of fraud, leading to the attempted festival organizer serving four years in prison. Shortly after his release from prison in 2022, McFarland announced plans for a Fyre Festival 2. Those did not come to fruition, and instead, he chose to sell off the entire brand. Maybe the next owner, whose name is not yet publicly known, will host a festival of his own with it.",

    "title": "Nicki Minaj & Megan Thee Stallion Beef: A Timeline",
    "description": "Megan Thee Stallion and Nicki Minaj werenât always at each otherâs necks. In fact, there was a time, only back in 2020, where their dynamic was much different, and significantly less antagonistic. Megan once considered herself a fan of Minaj, in awe of the fact that she was able to land a feature from the First Lady of Young Money on what became, to that point, her biggest song so far. Nicki showed Megan love for her skill on the mic and intelligence away from music, as she worked on finishing her college degree while taking care of a budding rap career. Unfortunately, their relationship soured almost as quickly as it began. Save for a few days in January 2024, they have largely been on opposite ends of a cold war for the last several years. The quick rise and fall put an end to another promising partnership, but what really happened? How did one of Meganâs biggest idols become one of her leading rivals? Letâs revisit, starting from the beginning. Read More: Megan, Halle, & Cassie Spoke Up â And Got Doubted, Not Defended  In May 2019, following a couple of EPs and the 2018 single âBig Ole Freak,â her breakout moment and the single that got her on the radio, Megan Thee Stallion released Fever. The commercial mixtape debuted in the top 10 on the Billboard 200 and spawned her first top 40 single, âCash S**tâ with DaBaby. After that breakthrough, she enlisted Nicki Minaj and Ty Dolla $ignâs help for the track âHot Girl Summer,â which dropped on August 9. Prior to the song dropping, Megan and Nicki got on Instagram Live together to chat. The two of them praised each other, and Megan revealed that sheâd been a Barb since 2008. After the livestream ended, Minaj admitted on X that there were originally no plans for her to appear on âHot Girl Summer.â However, once she heard the song, she started writing to it the same night. The song proved to be a success for both parties, reaching #11 on the Hot 100 and going double platinum, becoming Meganâs first major hit single. It also began what turned out to be a short-lived alliance between the pair, with it being the lone song theyâd release before things went left. Read More: Megan Thee Stallion's \"Hot Girl Summer\" Video With Nicki Minaj & Ty Dolla $ign Is Here In August 2020, Megan Thee Stallion and Cardi B came out with âWAP,â a viral moment that went on to become one of the most popular duets in hip-hop history. Of course, the feud between Nicki Minaj and Cardi B is well-documented. Their sneak disses culminated in Cardi trying to fight Minaj during New York Fashion Week in September 2018. Their beef did not end on that night, with the two continuing to take aim at each other nearly seven years later. âWAP,â a collaboration between Minajâs most recent endorsee and a woman Minaj almost fought, is what fans might call âmessy.â Despite that, Nicki praised Megan in a Variety cover story released just a couple of days before the song came out. âOne of my favorite things about Meg is her desire to further her education. Itâs so important for women to feel inspired to achieve goals outside of social media, where the focus is usually placed on their bodies or who theyâre dating at the time,â Minaj told the magazine at the time. âWAPâ went on to debut atop the Billboard Hot 100, where it stayed for four weeks, and has since gone platinum eight times over. Read More: Nicki Minaj Vs. Cardi B: A Complete Timeline  In November, Megan sat down for an interview with WGCI in Chicago. She was asked if she spoke to Minaj before agreeing to work with one of her fiercest rivals. âI didnât feel like I had to call her first. I mean, because at the end of the day, Iâm still an artist and I should be free to work with whoever I want to work with. My personal relationship with anybody doesnât affect what I choose to do as an artist,â she told The Morning Show. âI feel like women, we really do know how to coexist and we really do know how to not be catty, so despite popular Internet opinion, thatâs really not the case.â At the time, it seemed like the two were still on good terms. In hindsight, it marked the beginning of the end. Read More: Megan Thee Stallion Believes \"Fear & Insecurity\" Is Why Men Oppose \"WAP\"  In January 2021, Nicki Minaj went on a mass unfollowing spree on Instagram, completely clearing her list for a period. Megan Thee Stallion, Doja Cat, and Ariana Grande were among the first names Minaj removed. While she eventually refollowed Grande, the other two were not so lucky. Minajâs appearance on the remix to Doja Catâs âSay Soâ in 2019 helped Minaj capture her previously elusive number-one song, but it looked as if that relationship was over. It also quickly became clear that Minaj and Meganâs relationship was over as well. In May, Minaj re-released Beam Me Up Scotty, the 2009 mixtape that helped establish her core fanbase. Because sshe couldn't clear some songs from the original tape, she added new ones in their place. Those new tracks included âSeeing Greenâ with Drake and Lil Wayne. \"Seeing Green\" marked the first time the trio appeared on a song together since 2017. On the track, Minaj seems to throw shade in Meganâs direction. âThese b***hes thirsty, I can see why they alcoholics,â she says about halfway through the verse. Megan has faced criticism for what some have perceived as excessive drinking habits, whether at parties or on Instagram Live. That line, combined with Meganâs history and the mutual unfollowing, effectively confirmed yet another dissolution of a friendship between Minaj and a collaborator/fan. Read More: Fans Think Nicki Minaj & Cardi B Are Taking Shots At Each Other  Following the release of her fourth album, Queen, Nicki Minaj used to occasionally host a show called Queen Radio. The show started as an Apple Music venture for Minaj to play some of her favorite songs. But when it became an independent venture in 2020, it evolved into an outlet for her to periodically tell stories about drama in her life. She also used it to take jabs at rappers she had issues with. During the September 11, 2022 edition, which she dubbed the âTea Party,â Minaj told a story about how in 2020, Megan Thee Stallion allegedly told her to get an abortion. According to her, Megan tried to force her to drink when she was pregnant. She refused, explaining her potential pregnancy to Megan. Megan reportedly told Minaj she could âgo to the clinicâ in response. Minaj eventually gave birth to her first son in September of that year. âImagine telling someone you didnât want to drink because you were, at the time, possibly pregnant. Because you were actively having a baby,â Nicki said on the broadcast. âImagine if that person said, âOh girl, you can go to the clinic [...] Imagine posting photos that you are pregnant and the person doesnât even like it or say congratulations. But then when you post that BeyoncÃ© sent you flowers congratulating you, the person then tried to send you flowers thinking that, âOh, I can use this opportunity,â as she does everyone else. âSheâll post the flowers.â I didnât even let them s***s in the motherf***ing house.â When a fan brought Minajâs comments to Meganâs attention, she emphatically denied the rumors, branding the story a âLIE.â Read More: Worst Nicki Minaj's Beefs Of Her Career  Though Nicki Minaj released the hit single âSuper Freaky Girlâ in December 2022, coming out with âRed Ruby Da Sleezeâ in March of the following year felt like the formal start of the rollout for Pink Friday 2, her long-awaited comeback five years after the release of Queen. âSuper Freaky Girlâ was a fun, spiritual successor to âAnaconda.â At the same time, it did not feel like a lyrical return to form. However, \"Red Ruby Da Sleeze\" certainly does. Over a sample of Lumideeâs âNever Leave You,â Minaj is as spiteful as ever. She delivers multiple lines that fans could reasonably only read as jabs at Megan. âSeven hundred on them horses when we fixinâ to leave / But I donât f**k with horses since Christopher Reevesâ she raps, referencing both the equestrian incident that led to the actorâs paralysis and Megan, as a stallion is another word for a horse. On the second verse, she raps âyou f***ing bozo, that .40 calâll make âem dance like a go-go.â When Tory Lanez shot Megan Thee Stallion, he reportedly said âdance, b***h, danceâ as he fired shots. That remark would also not be the last time that Minaj used the shooting as a punchline. Whatever positive mentor/mentee relationship Megan and Minaj had at one point completely disintegrated in under four years. Read More: Is Nicki Minaj's Wild Barbz Fanbase Out Of Control?  On December 8, Nicki Minaj released Pink Friday 2, the sequel to her hugely successful debut album. On the track âFTCU,â she seemingly took another dig at Megan. âStay in your Tory lane, b***h, Iâm not Iggy,â she rapped on the songâs second verse. The line refers to a letter that Iggy Azalea reportedly wrote in support of Tory Lanez shortly before his sentencing. Some fans read it as a diss in Azaleaâs direction. Minajâs fans argued that she actually meant for the lyric to target Megan. In 2019, Megan and Azalea had a brief misunderstanding that some interpreted as a feud. The implication with the bar was that Minaj was not as forgiving as Azalea. The âBarbzâ were seemingly vindicated in their assessment of the lyric. Moreover, the war of thinly veiled statements and subliminals finally reached the tipping point heading into the new year. Read More: Nicki Minaj \"Pink Friday 2\" Review  In October 2023, 1501 Certified Entertainment announced that they reached a settlement with Megan Thee Stallion. The settlement ended a years-long legal battle and finally granted her independence. Shortly after, she announced her third album, Megan, with the lead single âCobra.â On January 22, 2024, she announced that âHiss,â the albumâs second single, would drop four days later. Thereâs no easy way to describe the impact that âHissâ landed with. If âCobraâ was Mike Tysonâs left jab, âHissâ was Tysonâs right hook. In the first verse, Megan raps âthese h**s donât be mad at Megan, these h**s mad at Meganâs Law.â Meganâs Law requires authorities to release information about registered sex offenders to the public. Nicki Minajâs husband, Kenneth Petty, has been a registered sex offender for decades, following an attempted rape conviction in 1995. He spent four years behind bars for the crime. Minajâs brother Jelani is also a sex offender, after being convicted of predatory sexual assault of a child younger than 13 years old. With that in mind, itâs not difficult to see why both Minaj and hip-hop fans believed Megan directed the line at her. It is a hard-hitting diss track that features Megan taking on several of her biggest enemies with her urgent, relentless flow, over a brooding beat. Fans later credited her for kicking off 2024 with the ruthless energy that eventually contributed to Drake and Kendrick Lamarâs battle, especially after her own disses in the formerâs direction on the track. Overall, fans greeted \"Hiss\" with considerable acclaim thanks to Megan's performance and focus. Its critical success reflected on the charts with another number-one single for her, the first solo one of her career. Read More: Megan Thee Stallion \"Megan\" Review  Following âHiss,â Minaj went straight to Instagram to air some of her grievances with Megan Thee Stallion. âYou bringing up 30-year-old tea from when this man was a 15-year-old child. You bringing up 30-year-old tea 'cause no man will ever f***ing love you, and lying on your dead mother,â she said. She further discussed the matter during a conversation Friday on Stationhead, a community-based radio app. âYou let everyone be thrown under the bus,â Minaj said. âYou let DaBaby be thrown under the bus, Tory, your best friend, your mom [...] Go conjure up your mother and apologize. Thatâs disgusting.â She also made several posts on X, calling Megan a âdisgusting serpant.â She later posted, âMeganâs Law. For a free beat you could hit #Meganraw,â a remark that she later included in her âHissâ response. âTold me to drink & go to the clinic if I was pregnant,â Minaj added on Twitter. âAll b/c I wouldnât let your funky butt pour liquor down my throat? B!ch think she a bully cuz she get a Roc Nation brunch every year.â Minaj continued in another tweet that she âdoes not condone âbullying,ââ but called Megan a âpathological & manipulative liar.â She also made an unsubstantiated claim that Megan employs ghostwriters. Read More: Nicki Minaj's Albums, Ranked  The same night âHissâ dropped, Nicki Minaj went live on Instagram to play a snippet of a diss track of her own. Three days later, she dropped âBig Foot.â It immediately entered the pantheon of poor diss track responses, seated next to Jay-Zâs âSupa Uglyâ and Meek Millâs âWanna Know.â Minaj once again called Megan an alcoholic, saying she âdrinks Henny through a straw.â She also reiterated her belief that Megan lied about being shot. âBad b***h, she like six foot, I call her Bigfoot/ The b***h fell off, I said, 'Get up on your good foot,â she raps early in the lone verse. âYou was lyinâ to the queen, then you went lyinâ to the King, Gayle,â she says later on, referring to the interview King did with Megan following the shooting. Megan did post a photo of her injury. However, both Minaj and many of her fans believe the injury came from broken glass. âF**k you get shot with no scar?â Minaj questions. She also suggested that Megan slept with Tory Lanez, who ex-friend Kelsey Harris previously dated, before the shooting. Minaj said that Megan had an âevil spirit,â and again asserted that she âlied on her dead mother.â After the verse, Minaj delivers a bizarre two-minute rant to close the track. It sounds much more like an ASMR clip than an attempt at hitting a bitter rival where it hurts. She makes vague threats about having âa lotta tea,â shouts out her fans, and implies that âBig Footâ had a second part. Minaj later revealed that she had four more songs ready to drop after âBig Foot.â Does that sound familiar? None of the other four songs saw the light of day. After a strong debut on the streaming charts, the track plummeted in the days after. It was such an underwhelming response attempt that their back and forth completely ended for months after, save for Megan cracking a few jokes at the songâs expense. They briefly ended the sneak dissing with their most direct statements to each other of the entire feud. Unfortunately, it did not result in a prolonged battle. Read More: Nicki Minaj \"Big Foot\": A Lyrical Breakdown Of The Megan Thee Stallion Diss  In June, Megan Thee Stallion finally dropped Megan, almost seven months after first announcing it. Fans wondered if sheâd have anything to say about Minaj, as she did not respond to âBig Foot.\" She largely stayed away from addressing Minaj. However, there were a few lines aimed in her direction, on the tracks âRattleâ and âFigueroa.â On the latter, she raps, âIâm a motherf***ing brat, not a Barbie,â a not-so-subtle reference to the \"Barbie Tingz\" rapper. She also takes aim on âRattle,â with a more in-depth reaction than the previous line. âDamn b*tch, itâs been four years / Worry âbout your man and your kid / Your life must be boring as f*ck if youâre still reminiscinâ âbout sh*t we did,â she raps on the track. It wasnât quite a full diss track as some may have hoped. Still, the lines served as an acknowledgement of Minajâs track and essentially put the recorded responses to rest. Read More: Megan Thee Stallion Takes Aim On \"Hiss\": Breaking Down The Bars Toward Her Targets  In September 2024, Megan Thee Stallion covered Billboardâs R&B/Hip-Hop Power Players issue. During the interview, she was asked about the inciting incident that led to her and Nicki Minaj falling out. âI still to this day donât know what the problem is. I donât even know what could be reconciled because I, to this day, donât know what the problem is,â she said in response. She defended the decision to release âHiss,â saying âI just knew what I had to do and what I had to say,â as Minaj continued to throw shade at her. âIâm going to keep doing what Iâm doing,â Megan said earlier in the interview. âIf people feel like Iâm somebody to aim at, then I must be pretty high up if youâre reaching up at me. I must be some kind of competition. That makes me feel good. That makes me feel like I could rap because if I wasnât the s**t, yâall wouldnât be worried about me.â Meganâs comments did not spark a reaction from Minaj, and it was particularly interesting to note that Megan did not completely close the door on reconciliation happening one day. Read More: Tory Lanezâs New Alleged Evidence In Megan Thee Stallion Case Has Not Been Filed In Court  Megan Thee Stallion performed at Coachella on April 14 and 21. During her set from the first weekend, she brought out Queen Latifah, Ciara, and Victoria MonÃ©t. Despite their involvement, the main discussion stemming from her performance was the inclusion of what appeared to be a dancer in a Bigfoot costume. Of course, fans immediately assumed Megan was referencing Nicki Minajâs diss track. The move received a bit of a mixed reception. While some saw the Bigfoot moment as entertaining, others felt the move was one that happened too long after the on-wax portion of their beef. They argued that the ideal time to take such a shot would have been when Megan went on the Hot Girl Summer tour in June and July of 2024, while things were still fresh. Ultimately, the Bigfoot cameo was a bit of harmless fun for Megan and her fans, serving as another humorous acknowledgement of the song while continuing to not give it the full-length response some hip-hop listeners may have hoped she would. Read More: Megan Thee Stallionâs Pink Tour Look Leaves Nicki Minaj Fans Suspicious  In April 2024, Megan Thee Stallion was hit with a shocking lawsuit. Photographer Emilio Garcia claimed that Megan forced him to watch her have sex in the back of a moving car and created a generally hostile work environment. A month later, Meganâs legal team issued a statement saying the lawsuit âconsists almost entirely of falsehoods, misrepresentations of fact, and outlandish claims.\" It was especially shocking because though Megan makes raunchy songs, the allegations were inconsistent with her public persona. On July 8, 2025, a federal judge determined that the suit would move forward despite Megan and Roc Nation (with whom she signed a management agreement in 2019) motioning to dismiss it. Nicki Minaj did not waste any time bringing the beef back to the forefront. She reposted a tweet from Akademiks TV on Instagram. âWhat was the name of that law again???????? Karmaâs Law?â she opened, referring back to the âHissâ line. âTouch not my anointed law? Vengeance is the Lordâs law? We give God the glory & heâs only just begun. Have a blessed day if you can.â Minaj has been in a mostly one-sided battle against Jay-Z for years, and she recently claimed that the legendary MC-turned-mogul owes her somewhere between $100 million and $200 million. Megan has been with Roc Nation since 2019, so the suit moving forward at the same time as Minaj once again placing Jay in her sights likely felt like divine intervention. Despite the comments, Megan has not responded at the time of this writing. Regardless, with Minaj refueling the feud between her and Megan after it being largely dormant for over a year, Megan may feel compelled to respond in some way. Whatever path toward peace may have existed when Megan suggested that ending the beef was still a possibility may be all but closed now.",

    "title": "Tyler, The Creator's \"CHROMAKOPIA\" Tour: A Master Of His Craft Made MSG Feel Like Home",
    "description": "It's hard for Tyler, The Creator fans to pick a favorite \"era\" from the Hawthorne native's illustrious and beautifully turbulent career. They may seem wholly distinct at face value, but every IGOR has its roots in a Bastard; every \"SORRY NOT SORRY\" has a \"Sam (Is Dead)\" to thank. Whether he stumbled upon it or coldly calculated the trajectory, it's astounding to see the resonant qualities that stuck around after Tyler's post-Flower Boy public image. Nowhere is that history clearer than in his latest album CHROMAKOPIA. More significantly, nothing embodied that better than his world tour for the project, which stopped for its first of two nights in New York City's Madison Square Garden on Monday, July 14. After an incredibly vibrant opening set from Paris Texas (the dark horse of the world tour) and Lil Yachty's nonchalant and dreamy moshes, the former Odd Future frontman launched headfirst into his October 2024 LP. Yes, the hair looks bigger in person; and no, T hasn't lost his fire. \"St. Chroma\" and \"Rah Tah Tah\" sounded even livelier than their studio equivalents thanks to his raspy growls and his keen ability to ebb and flow dynamically even in steadier verses. From there on out, this concert series fulfilled its promise of a very cogent representation of the 34-year-old's artistry, a visual diary of CHROMAKOPIA's themes of maturity, and the most well-flowing and immersive Tyler set this writer's seen yet. Read More: Tyler The Creator Boldly Proclaims \"F**K ICE\" Amid Los Angeles Protests  As someone with a few arena tours under his belt now, it feels like Tyler, The Creator and his team have really perfected making the most out of the setting. Large CHROMAKOPIA shipment crates were the main attraction, and featured the most impressive bells and whistles: sparks raining down, flames bursting up, fireworks popping off, and the shadow spots that Tyler raps about on \"NOID.\" That track's killer performance was elevated by striking camera angles in sepia on MSG's screens. Throughout the concert, the former Odd Future frontman's team made sure to capture compelling visual details in gorgeous frames, whether it was his hand's performance during \"I Killed You\" or his foreboding silhouette and facial expressions with light blasting behind him. There were dazzling arrangements and decisions in this regard, as steady smoke made the whole arena not just look yellow, but feel yellow. It felt like every lighting aspect contributed to a given song's atmosphere, whether it was flashing to replicate synth arpeggios or wistfully drifting through the crowd like a lost love. Later on, a rusty crate walkway led to Tyler, The Creator's house towards the center of the venue for the show's second half, complete with a record player, a comfy sofa, and a keyboard. This was where he went through his vinyls and played his classics. Although Tyler wasn't as conversational as he's been in previous tours, it was still a very intimate part of the set that emphasized CHROMAKOPIA's central mission: heading back home. Read More: Tyler The Creator & Doechii Premiere New Song During Louis Vuitton Show  Furthermore, this was the most impressive part of Tyler, The Creator's latest tour, albeit the least shocking one. CHROMAKOPIA already lends itself perfectly to a well-flowing, cohesive, progressive, and narrative interpretation. However, via the setlist's organization and Tyler's consistently passionate and all-on-the-floor performances, the album's themes have never been clearer. His vibrance during \"Darling, I\" is exactly the fun-loving exuberance he raps about on that track, and for \"Judge Judy,\" he paid tribute to some legendary musicians who have recently passed away like Roberta Flack and Roy Ayers. Despite the song's chilled-out instrumentation, there was a somber quality to T's improvised spoken word and choreography. Side note: this man's got moves, and it was very fun to see him enjoy his own material via an underrated aspect of contemporary hip-hop performance. The blunt and stern honesty of \"Take Your Mask Off\" turned into indignant chaos onstage, and Tyler seemed even harsher with himself. That's when he took the mask off (shocker) and went into his home for a \"Tomorrow\" rendition while the floating house lowered onto the floor. All in all, these musical moments came with new intros, outros, and instrumentals that added to their wonder. Tyler, The Creator also specified certain lyrics even more, adding to this up-front sense of vulnerability by being even more explicit with what he means. For example, the \"unjustified investment\" he rapped about on the album is now $14 million. If anyone didn't get the idea with the record, they certainly will now. Read More: Maxo Kream Floats On Tyler, The Creator-Produced New Single \"Cracc At 15\"  The one thing hardcore Tyler, The Creator fans might have a bone to pick with on this tour is that he just has too many great and iconic tracks at this point. As such, his returns to his earlier material like CMIYGL and Goblin, among other aforementioned albums, are very tried and true at this point thanks to multiple tours perfecting the selection. It led to the concert feeling like it wrapped up pretty quickly, but that's also because the whole crowd was loving every second. Time flew by, and that's probably the desired outcome rather than stretched-out or overly indulgent reminiscing. Speaking of which, whenever the Golf Le Fleur boss did address the crowd, he was charismatic, grateful, warm, and focused. He thanked his heroes once again, and this time around, Clipse were actually in the crowd to hear it for themselves. Speaking of the Thornton brothers, the most surprising part of the show was Tyler rapping his killer \"P.O.V.\" feature off Let God Sort Em Out over \"Rusty.\" But for this catalog section of the CHROMAKOPIA tour, he balanced out all the ragers and sweeteners very well. There aren't as many deep cuts anymore, but one of the best parts of The Creator's live approach is how he caters to the folks watching him for the first time, every time. And it makes for consistent examples of why he's arguably hip-hop's best performer today. Read More: Pusha T Explains How Tyler The Creator's \"P.O.V.\" Feature Came To Be  While closing out this Madison Square Garden show, Tyler, The Creator skillfully mastered tension and release with his final tracks: an a cappella outro for \"Thought I Was Dead,\" the hypnotizing tenderness of \"Like Him,\" the loving longing of \"See You Again,\" and the explosive darkness of \"NEW MAGIC WAND.\" After other massive hits like \"Who Dat Boy,\" \"Yonkers,\" \"LUMBERJACK,\" and \"Tamale,\" it felt like he wrapped the concert up with tracks that encompassed all the skills he's built over the years. It was amazing to witness. By the time \"I Hope You Find Your Way Home\" wished the crowd farewell, and Tyler stood atop an air vent whisking him away, it felt like MSG experienced a whole career's journey with more maturity, intention, and dedication than they had seen from him before. He seeks to prove that not just with spectacle and grandeur, but most importantly, through giving 150 percent effort in every bar, croon, and scream from the heart. Tyler, The Creator found his way home on CHROMAKOPIA, and his live rendition of that process is the most cathartic and impressive joy any Tyler fan could be blessed by: an era to end all eras.

    "description": "Sexyy Red brought out several stars to her three-night-long residency at the London nightclub, Tape, over the weekend. According to TMZ, she welcomed Latto, Yeat, Zack Bia, DDG, Rubi Rose, Loe Shimmy, and Ben Da Don to the stage at various times. Tape chose Sexyy Red to be the club's inaugural act in its new artist residency series. The entire weekend was sold out. In addition to her performances at Tape, Sexyy Red was also in the United Kingdom to join Drake on stage during his headlining set at Wireless Festival. He performed a total of three nights at the iconic event and brought out his \"Rich Baby Daddy\" collaborator on Saturday. Her appearance was part of a harder-hitting theme he went with for the night, following a celebration of R&B on Friday. âAll that sweetheart, singing sh*t? That sh*t is over tonight. This is for my motherf*cking dogs. I see my dogs came out tonight,\" he said on stage. Other performers included Skepta, Latto, Fakemink, K-Trap, Dave, Central Cee, J Hus, Yeat, Headie One, and 21 Savage.

In celebrating its release, Bieber posted a video of himself dancing with Sexyy in the studio on Instagram. â@sexyyred ðððð ððð ðððððð ð ð ð ð ð ð ð ð ð ð ð ð ð ð ð . ððð ðð ðð ðððð ððð ðð ð ððð ððð ðð,\" he wrote in the caption. The move led to plenty of social media drama as users in the comments section labeled their antics inappropriate. Many said it was disrespectful to Bieber's wife, Hailey. Sexyy ended up personally clapping back. âI see two friends of the opposite sexx having fun making music about their significant others I donât see anything wrong.

    "title": "SZA Calls Out AI For \"Killing & Polluting Black & Brown Cities\"",
    "description": "SZA took to her Instagram Story on Tuesday to issue a firm critique of artificial intelligence. In doing so, she shared a meme of The X-Filesâ character, Dana Scully, with the words: âYeah, I use AI. Actual Imagination.â As caught by Complex, she captioned the picture: âAI is killing and polluting Black and Brown cities. None of you care âcause [youâre] codependent on a machine. Have a great life.â SZA's post comes after Elon Musk's AI firm, xAI, announced that it won a $200 million contract with the US Department of Defense. According to The Guardian, the company will be developing and implementing artificial intelligence tools for the agency. âUnder the umbrella of Grok For Government, we will be bringing all of our world-class AI tools to federal, local, state, and national security customers,â xAI said in a statement on its website. âThese customers will be able to use the Grok family of products to accelerate America â from making everyday government services faster and more efficient to using AI to address unsolved problems in fundamental science and technology.â Back in April, xAI came under fire for its Memphis data center, which locals claim has allegedly become one of the biggest air polluters in the entire county. It's situated near multiple historically Black neighborhoods, according to The Guardian. At the facility, the company is working on a supercomputer to power the Grok chatbot.

The aforementioned Grok chatbot recently caused backlash for the company by making several antisemitic posts on X (formerly Twitter) and even referring to itself as \"MechaHitler.\" At one point, Grok also provided tips on sexually assaulting one user. Afterward, the company issued an apology. âFirst off, we deeply apologize for the horrific behavior that many experienced,\" they wrote. âOur intent for @grok is to provide helpful and truthful responses to users. After careful investigation, we discovered the root cause was an update to a code path upstream of the @grok bot. This is independent of the underlying language model that powers @grok.

    "description": "A former mansion belonging to the late rapper Juice Wrld was reportedly the site of a disturbing double-homicide in Los Angeles on Monday. According to XXL, police found the bodies of American Idol music supervisor Robin Kaye and her husband, Thomas Deluca, at the home. The two both suffered gunshot wounds to the head and were pronounced dead at the scene. On Tuesday, police arrested 22-year-old suspect Raymond Boodarian and charged him with double homicide. Authorities claimed surveillance video from the property showed him allegedly scaling the couple's fence. They suspect he entered through an unlocked door. \"He was there for approximately half an hour,\" Lt. Guy Golan told the press. \"When the homeowners returned to their residence, a violent struggle ensued and between them and the suspect, which resulted in the victims tragically losing their lives.\" On July 10, just four days before the incident, police responded to a possible burglary at the same address. They found no visible signs of forced entry at the time. Investigators are still trying to determine whether the suspect had any prior connection to Kaye and Deluca. American Idol addressed the incident in a statement provided to PEOPLE. \"Weâre devastated to hear of Robin and her dear husband, Tomâs, passing,\" they said. \"Robin has been a cornerstone of the Idol family since 2009 and was truly loved and respected by all who came in contact with her. Robin will remain in our hearts forever and we share our deepest sympathy with her family and friends during this difficult time.â Read More: Juice WRLD & XXXTENTACION Find \"The Way\" On New Single  Earlier this month, Juice Wrld's estate celebrated his legacy with a deluxe reissue of his chart-topping third album. Legends Never Die (5 Year Anniversary Edition) features several new songs from the late rapper, including âIn My Headâ âFace 2 Faceâ and âThe Wayâ featuring XXXTentacion. Juice Wrld died back in December 2019 after suffering a drug overdose at Midway International Airport in Chicago. Authorities were waiting there for his flight from Los Angeles to land and searched through the luggage, suspecting there to be guns and drugs. As they did so, Juice allegedly swallowed multiple Percocet pills. Read More: EMPIRE Is Releasing A New XXXTENTACION & Juice WRLD Remix For Fortnite",

    "description": "The alleged father of Skai Jackson's son, Deondre Burgin is under arrest again. This time, he was handcuffed in Kenton County, Kentucky, and it all stems from his outstanding warrant in Ohio. It appears that this is the real report compared to the last one we got word of back in April that reads the exact same. But if you missed that news, here's a refresher? Per TMZ, Deondre was at a gas station in this Kentucky county on July 14. While there, he was washing down his vehicle that he shouldn't have been behind the wheel of to begin with. That's because of the aforementioned warrant that was placed on him back on May 5. Burgin received that because he failed to show up in court for a ticket he got on March 6. The Hamilton County, Ohio Prosecutor's Office tells the outlet Deondre was issued one due to him failing to renew his driver's license and for not displaying his license's plate properly. This left the Kenton County Police no choice but to arrest him after they did a plate check. It was done at random but it's a routine practice according to the Kenton County Commonwealth Attorney's Office. Although, last time it was reported that an officer recognized him from the National Crime Information Center database after spotting him at this same gas station.

This time though, there's nothing to report in that regard. Either way though, this is just another crippling obstacle that he and Skai Jackson are facing. It's been nothing but one unfortunate headline after another for both of them. Recently, Deondre accused the former Disney actress of perpetuating fake news to ruin his life. \"@skaijackson If a fake page text any of my followers spreading false rumors about me itâs my baby momma tryna ruin my life lol #falsenews,\" he said on an IG Story. Jackson reportedly acquired a temporary restraining order against him over a history of alleged abuse. In one alleged instance, Jackson claims that Burgin held her, while pregnant, at knife point and tried to get her to drink bleach. Read More: Lil Durk's Mixtapes, Ranked",

    "title": "Diddy's Sentencing Gets Tentative Date After Divisive Mixed Verdict",
    "description": "The Diddy trial has finally come to a major close after the jury's controversial mixed verdict, but there is still a lot of legal water for Sean Combs to wade through. After Judge Arun Subramanian denied him bond, the big question on everyone's mind is when he will get his prison sentence, and what it will look like. For those unaware, the Bad Boy mogul's trial's jury found him guilty of two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution. But they found him not guilty of two counts of sex trafficking and one count of racketeering, which were the more severe charges in this case. As for what the jury actually convicted Combs for, these crimes reportedly do not carry a mandatory minimum prison sentence. On the other hand, each count carries a maximum sentence of 10 years each. This could result in 20 years behind bars if each sentence reaches the maximum and if they run consecutively rather than concurrently. Also, this opens up the question of whether or not Judge Subramanian will credit the time Diddy has already served in jail. Then again, this is all heavy legal speculation that only the court has any real authority on. So take folks' interpretations online with a grain of salt. Read More: Did Diddy Beat The Case? Everything To Know About His Conviction & Sentencing So with all that in mind, what did Judge Arun Subramanian say about Diddy's potential sentence? According to E! News Online, the judge set a tentative sentencing date for October 3 of this year. However, this still did not set itself in stone. Prosecutors and defense attorneys will reportedly consider an earlier sentencing date in a hearing next week on Tuesday, July 8. Furthermore, both sides of the court unsurprisingly seek different sentences. Prosecutors reportedly want 51 to 63 months, whereas defense attorneys reportedly asked for 21 to 27 months. Meanwhile, reactions to the Diddy verdict continue to spark firestorms on social media. Whether it's from supporters or detractors, there is a lot to take in. But at the end of the day, most of the general population knows that these questions about sentencing are far more important.

The album marks Bieber's first release since breaking away from Scooter Braun, with whom he settled a multi-million dollar financial dispute, earlier this month. A source for Rolling Stone told the outlet that the move allowed for him to have more \"creative freedom\" with the project than ever before. âHaving full creative freedom, sadly, is something new for him as an artist. Not having to stress about creating the perfect single, or perfect album allowed for him to create the best body of music heâs ever made,\" they said.

He lives up to his Punchline King nickname on this track dropping one liners like, \"Got it off the musclÐµ, they want me taking relaxers (Uh).\" The former G-Unit star flows over a menacing and eerie boom bap beat that feels nostalgic but also fresh at the same time. At this point, we need a compilation project of all of his off-the-dome raps. Fans are championing this one in the YouTube comments, too. \"Banks last three uploads are some of his best in a couple years, which is saying a lot,\" one user says. \"I see banks, I click period. Best rapper alive hands down!\" another adds. Hopefully, Banks is reading the comments because they are just as hungry as we are for more of these strong displays.

    "description": "Drake recently stunned fans at his first 2025 Wireless Festival headlining night on Friday (July 11), and it was amazing to see. However, some eagled-eyed fans noticed a pretty important beef update when it comes to his opposition. As caught by NFR Podcast on Twitter, he seemingly replaced his LeBron James tattoo with another NBA star. For those unaware, Drizzy had Bron's Fighting Irish jersey tattooed on his left arm, and now, he's rocking Shai Gilgeous-Alexander's jersey. Toronto native SGA just won the championship with the Oklahoma City Thunder, and he appeared in the music video for \"NOKIA.\" As such, it seems like Drake's LeBron James beef couldn't be any clearer. Fans already connected the situation to various bars, tracks, and statements the 6ix God has made over the last year or so. Things started when James popped out at the Kendrick Lamar concert on Juneteenth last year, and they haven't gotten any clarification from the basketball legend himself. With that in mind, fans don't really know if this is one-sided or if Bron already had some issues. Nevertheless, any fans of both are still in a tough spot. Read More: Chris Brown Pleads Not Guilty To Additional UK Assault Charges  As for what this new SGA tattoo means for Drake, that's only for him to know. But we can presume their Toronto ties run deep, and there's also plenty of reason to celebrate Shai Gilgeous-Alexander individually. The 2025 MVP, Finals MVP, and scoring title boaster just had the best year of his career so far. Meanwhile, LeBron James and Drake's reconciliation seems no closer. The former recently and allegedly liked an Instagram post about Future supposedly responding to the new song from The Boy, \"What Did I Miss?\" This is after fans interpreted a few bars on there as being potential shots towards James. We will see whether or not either mega-celebrity directly addresses this issue in the near future. It seems unlikely based on how they moved over the past year. If they wanted to say something, they probably already would have. But maybe this is just the new normal, and the shade will continue. Either way, they are both too busy to worry about it so constantly. Read More: Gervonta Davis Reportedly Arrested For Alleged Domestic Violence",

    "description": "On July 9, Megan Thee Stallion made an Instagram post, and eagle-eyed viewers quickly noticed a man that looked suspiciously like Klay Thompson sitting on a poolside chair in the background. Shortly after, TMZ confirmed the relationship. On July 12, Thompson made a post recapping a trip to The Bahamas, with multiple photos featuring a woman who was unmistakably Megan. A couple of days later, Megan made an Instagram video of herself opening Labubus that Thompson bought her, while sitting on his lap. Of course, the relationship has sparked a variety of opinions, ranging from support for Megan to hating on Thompson. Fellow Houston rapper Slim Thug delivered his reaction to the news on Instagram Live. One of Slim's friends, who was off-camera, said \"that boy Klay shot the 3 on 'em.\" He responded by \"saluting\" Thompson, adding that he was happy for the new couple and adding, \"they look good.\" Of course, the comments were quick to crack jokes at Slim Thug's expense, as he has been very vocal about wanting to date Megan Thee Stallion in the past. \"He gon' cry when he stops recording,\" wrote one user in response to the clip. Another posted a gif from Friday, where Smokey (played by Chris Tucker) says \"he gon' go cry in the car.\" Read More: Megan Thee Stallion Requests Direct Access To All Of Milagro Gramz Social Media Accounts In Defamation Case  Megan Thee Stallion has already turned Slim Thug down once this year, at Coachella. Slim thought that Megan calling him \"babe\" in his rejection implied interest. Clearly, that is not the case, and Megan has moved into a new relationship that she seems to be very happy in. As for Megan away from the new romance, she is currently caught in some legal drama. She sued Milagro Gramz for defamation and recently requested access to all of her social media accounts. In 2024, a former cameraman sued for sexual harassment. Last week, a judge ruled that the case will not be thrown out despite a motion for dismissal.

Several other people ran away in fear, unsure of what exactly was going on. âThe initial reports were that a woman was scared of an insect and screamed and ran away from it, and others panicked not knowing what was happening,â a MARTA spokesperson said.

The 15, inspired by the X-15 fighter jet and MJâs iconic tongue-out stance, never had the same mainstream love as other retros. But this âBlack Muslinâ colorway might change that. The upper sticks to the original design with its woven black body, while the Muslin shades on the midsole and heel add warmth and balance to the bold geometry. Itâs a subtle remix that keeps the attitude of the original while giving it a more wearable edge. Early previews, like the one seen above, highlight how well this combo works, especially with the sculpted sole and ribbed heel intact. Originally released in 1999 after MJâs second retirement, the Air Jordan 15 was the first model he never wore on court. Itâs been polarizing, but with the right storytelling and design, even the outliers can find their moment. This 23RE drop might just be that moment. Read More: Air Jordan 3 OG âBin 23â Is Going To Be Extremely Limited  The Air Jordan 15 23RE âBlack Muslinâ features a textured black woven upper that stretches from toe to heel, keeping the silhouetteâs sharp, angular look intact. A soft Muslin cream tone wraps the sculpted midsole, outsole, and heel support, offering contrast against the dark base. The iconic ribbed rear panel and aerodynamic shape remain untouched, while the collar features that signature protruding tongue. Subtle branding appears near the heel, staying true to the minimalist design. Itâs a bold take on an underdog model that feels both retro and refreshingly modern. Sneaker Bar Detroit reports that the Air Jordan 15 23RE âBlack Muslinâ will be released in the summer of 2026. Also, the retail price of the sneakers will be announced closer to when they drop.

    "title": "Conor McGregor Ignores Azealia Banks Nude Leak Scandal By Celebrating Turning 37 In Style",
    "description": "Azealia Banks dropped a bombshell on her volatile X account yesterday (July 14) with Conor McGregor being at the center of it. The rapper and singer put the UFC champion on blast for allegedly sending her \"unsolicited\" d*ck pics. \"How you gonna send a b**** some crooked d*** pics then threaten her not to tell. @TheNotoriousMMA n**** do you know who the f*** I am? This is HARAM.\" It's one thing to say something so shocking, but it's another to have proof to back it up. Azealia Banks had that to share as well, showing the alleged text chain with Conor McGregor. In the photos, the controversial athlete can be seen posing in the nude in what looks to be his closet. Alongside the bold photos are texts with one of them reading \"Lifting weights\" and another allegedly warning Banks to not be a \"rat.\" \"Don't be a rat cos all rats get caught.\" Azealia piled on Conor with subsequent tweets roasting his package further. \"Like how are you really going to sexually harrass me with the potato farmer d*ck then threaten me not to tell???? Honeyâ¦â¦ ainât u trying to be the president of Ireland what is it giving fam? Use some f*cking sunscreen damn.\" Read More: Eminem's Most Slept-On Freestyles, Ranked  What's more though is that this is allegedly nothing new between Banks and Conor. According to her, it's been going on for a while. \"No me and Conor McGregor have been sending each other unsolicited nudes since 2016. LOL,\" she alleged. \"I have never met the leprechaun but today is his birthday and he wants everyone to make a wish and blow out the candle â¦. Funny how big of closet maga bait that wasâ¦ Men are so homo and obsessed with d*ck itâs not even funny.\" But despite her attempts to embarrass him, the fighter couldn't care less, it seems. As caught by TMZ Sports, the Ireland native posted some cake day pics to social media earlier today. It looks he was having a blast as the now 37-year-old was on his yacht in Sardinia. Other flicks showed off his expensive timepiece, some flowers, balloons, as well as his son. It seems like Conor might not address this scandal head on, so we will see if Azealia Banks decides to try and pry some sort of reaction out of him down the road.

The charges include wire fraud, money laundering conspiracy, and bribery tied to federally funded programs. The U.S. Attorneyâs Office claims Pina began allegedly running a Ponzi-style investment scam in 2017 under the guise of flipping residential properties in New Jersey. Additionally, they allege he laundered drug money and even bribed a Paterson city official to push forward a real estate project. âCesar Pina is alleged to have misappropriated millions of dollars of peoplesâ hard-earned money, laundered money for narcotics traffickers, and bribed a politician in furtherance of real estate projects,â U.S. Attorney Alina Habba said, according to AllHipHop. âThis multi-year torrent of criminal activity hurt investors around the United States, facilitated the scourge of narcotics trafficking, and undermined confidence in our public officials.â DEA New Jersey Special Agent in Charge Cheryl Ortiz added in a U.S. Attorney's Office press release: âRather than utilize his social media presence for the betterment of society, Mr. Humberto Pina chose to use it to expand his criminal activities.

    "description": "The Air Jordan 4 âToro Bravoâ is making a long-awaited return in 2026, marking its first re-release since it originally dropped in 2013. This fiery red colorway quickly became a fan favorite for its bold design and nod to MJâs aggressive on-court energy. Back then, the pair stood out from the pack with its all-over red upper and contrasting black and grey hits, and that energy still hits today. The \"Toro Bravo\" name comes from the Spanish term for a fighting bull, and the look backs it up. This is one of the louder AJ4s out there, and itâs part of why people loved it. With Jordan Brand diving into retro re-releases and OGs, the 2026 return is timed perfectly. The Air Jordan 4 remains one of the most iconic sneakers in the entire Jordan line, known for its visible Air cushioning, plastic wings, and timeless design. New photos show the pair sticking closely to the 2013 version. The red suede upper is clean and vibrant, while the black and grey accents keep things balanced. Itâs shaping up to be one of 2026âs biggest releases. Read More: Air Jordan 11 Low âMotherâs Dayâ Celebrates Moms In A Bold Way  The Air Jordan 4 âToro Bravoâ comes dressed in bold red suede, with mesh netting along the side panels and tongue.

The Jumpman logo appears on the tongue and heel in white, keeping things sharp. This version sticks close to the original 2013 pair, delivering a faithful retro that captures the same intensity. Itâs loud, confident, and made for those who want their sneakers to make a statement. @zsneakerheadz reports that the Air Jordan 4 \"Toro Bravo\" will be released on May 23rd, 2026.

    "description": "Adin Ross felt that Jess Hilarious and The Breakfast Club were taking things too far in their interview with his friend and streaming contemporary, N3on. In a clip caught by Akademiks TV, Loren LoRosa stopped the conversation to read a venomous pinned comment left in the live chat by Ross. It read, \"N3on, I promise you they trying to belittle you and disrespect you. You sh*tting on all of them, they weird as f*ck. F*ck them.\" Adin then doubled down on the critique adding in all caps, \"I STAND ON THAT. YALL BELITTLING A VERY SUCCESSFUL YOUNG MAN. F*CK YOU B*TCH.\" That was left for Jess Hilarious who clapped back immediately after LoRosa read aloud the previous comment. \"This is not Adin Ross' interview so f*ck him, too,\" Jess retorted. N3on then jumped in to try and diffuse the tension in a half-joking manner. \"Woah woah wait we're all friends... I think we should all come together and spread happiness,\" he said. But Jess wasn't going for any of that. \"F*ck all that kumbaya sh*t. F*ck Adin,\" she doubled down. N3on defended his \"guy\" Ross, but again, Jess wasn't tolerating the disrespect. \"I don't give a f*ck,\" she clapped back while also bringing up one of N3on's past controversies regarding Harriet Tubman.

N3on defended himself and the chat's critiques of The Breakfast Club by saying this is just how the internet is and that its \"not a representation of [him],\" essentially. But Jess and Charlamagne in particular continued to grill the streamer on his past. For N3on, though, he stood firm on the fact that he's trying to change and become a better person. Moreover, if people don't want to believe that, then \"its f*ck you,\" according to him. While Ross is known to be in some tense situations just like N3on, the former was having a grand ol' time last week at the Wireless Festival. Drake flew him and a few other streamers out to come watch him perform as a triple-headlining act.

    "title": "OJ Simpson's Lawyer Commends Diddy's Wildly Similar Court Tactics Following Verdict",
    "description": "The results of Diddy's two-month long trial were quite shocking for a lot of people. So were they for former NFL star OJ Simpson, who was acquitted from his infamous double murder trial in 1995. But that's the just the tip of the iceberg in terms the similarities between these two huge cases. They have come to light this weekend thanks to comments made by the man who represented OJ three decades ago, Robert Shapiro. He was a part of that \"Dream Team\" and has also defended many others. Just a few include Eva Longoria, Rob Kardashian, and companies like Rockstar Energy. Caught by AllHipHop, Shapiro gave high marks to the leader of Diddy's legal defense, Teny Geragos and Marc Agnifilo, for how they handled the federal case. \"The defense team did a terrific job on a case the U.S. Attorney overcharged. An acquittal in Federal Court is highly unusual. Congratulations to Mark and Tenny for building an incredible group of talented lawyers,\" he told Fox News. For those wondering who was on the mogul's \"Dream Team,\" Brian Steel, Anna Estevao, Jason Driscoll, Xavier R. Donaldson and Alexandra Shapiro made up the proverbial roster. Read More: Kendrick Lamar's Grand National Tour Realizes pgLang Vision Also praising Teny and Marc was Harvard Law professor Alan Dershowitz. Note: this is where the uncanny similarities are even more eye-opening. \"Ultimately, the smart decision was not putting OJ on the witness stand. The smart decision here was not putting Combs on the witness stand. The difference is we want a complete victory. They got a partial victory, but an almost complete victory, so I commend them for excellent work,\" Mr. Dershowitz said. What's even more bizarre is that Diddy's sentencing date, which is October 3, 2025, is the same as OJ Simpson's. Of course, the running back didn't even serve time for his case, so we will see if the same outcomes continue in about three months. The Bad Boy CEO avoided complete disaster in his case though, as the father of seven was acquitted on the most serious counts. Those were RICO and sex trafficking. He was found guilty on two counts of transportation with intent to commit prostitution involving Cassie and \"Jane.\" Depending on how things shake out, he could go to prison for 20 years. Diddy is back in jail for the time being. Read More: Daphne Joyâs Complicated History With 50 Cent & Diddy: Co-Parenting To Courtroom Rumors",

    "description": "Last week, Clipse unleashed their first album in more than 15 years, Let God Sort Em Out. The highly anticipated project boasts various impressive features from the likes of Nas, Tyler The Creator, John Legend, and of course, Kendrick Lamar. The project has earned mixed reactions from listeners, but so far, the feedback appears to have been mostly positive. According to Kurrco, the project is expected to move 90K album-equivalent units its first week, and debut at No. 4 on the Billboard 200. These projections arrive just after Clipse added multiple new international dates to their upcoming tour. This includes dates in Tilburg, Paris, London, and Manchester. The tour, which was originally announced last month, is scheduled to begin in August with a show at the Roadrunner in Boston. After that, the duo will move onto cities like Philadelphia, New York, Virginia Beach, Miami, Atlanta, and more.

Recently, for example, she took to her Instagram Story to share footage of one of their latest video calls. She shared the footage shortly after posting some messages she exchanged with Blueface amid his incarceration, per The Shade Room. In them, she asked him to stop getting new tattoos on his face until he regains his freedom, prompting him to push back. \"I'm begging you please don't write on your fa fact no more.

    "title": "Freddie Gibbs & The Alchemist Are Apparently Dropping \"Alfredo 2\" Later This Month",
    "description": "July 2025 has been an absolute gold mine for hip-hop. We have witnessed ceremonious return of Clipse this past weekend with Let God Sort Em Out. Moreover, just two days later, Travis Scott and his JACKBOYS collective also reunited. They did so on Sunday, July 13, with their second eponymous project. Nicholas Craven and Boldy James and a surprise album from Justin Bieber surfaced, too. But with two weeks of July remaining, Metro Boomin and NBA YoungBoy are coming through. The former's A FUTURISTIC SUMMA hits DSPs on Tuesday, July 22, and YB's arrives Friday, July 25. But speaking of that day, Freddie Gibbs and The Alchemist are reportedly joining the party. They \"will\" be with their rumored sequel to Alfredo. Per Andrew Barber of Fake Shore Drive, he caught a screenshot of another hip-hop social media account by the name of belowthehiphop. They posted the Amazon Music pre-save for the Freddie Gibbs and The Alchemist project which shows the supposed July 25 release date. It's worth noting that belowthehiphop is followed by Anthony Fantano of theneedledrop, so there's some extra credibility to this report. However, we checked Amazon Music for ourselves and there's no pre-save in sight from what we could see. Read More: Lil Wayne & His Trump Lyrics: A Love Letter To Power  This was shared just about an hour ago at the time of writing, but there's a chance it could have been taken down. Something similar happened when we first got word of Freddie Gibbs and The Alchemist potentially coming through with Alfredo 2. In late June, the Gary, Indiana rapper had a lnk.to for the album surface, but when clicked on, a 404-error popped up. By the way, that remains true almost a month later. So, with all of that, we are still taking this with a grain of salt until we get actual confirmation from the artists. For what's worth though, the cover that we saw last month (a bowl of ramen instead of fettuccine alfredo), remains intact on the Amazon Music pre-save. Apparently, Alfredo 2 will consist of 14 tracks equating to a runtime of 47 minutes. Moreover, it will be out at 8:00 PDT on the 25th. Interestingly, Uncle Al's name isn't attached to the record. Instead, a smiling emoji and some Japanese symbols sit in its place. Although, it could be The Alchemist's name spelled out in that language. Overall, we are unsure of how true this all is, but we do hope that this is real. It's been over five years since the first Alfredo which was GRAMMY-nominated. It dropped on May 29, 2020, and had features from Rick Ross, Tyler, The Creator, Benny The Butcher, and Conway the Machine. Read More: Can Cardi Bâs \"Am I The Drama\" Beat the Sophomore Slump?",

    "description": "While most of the conversation around the Diddy trial these days concerns its uncertain future, there are still courtroom stories to go over. One of them emerged in an AllHipHop report about defense attorney Marc Agnifilo, who reportedly saved a life earlier this week. Various members of the court reportedly awaited Judge Arun Subramanian's decision on Diddy's potential bond on Wednesday afternoon (July 2) in Manhattan court. As we now know, this bail request from Sean Combs' team proved to be unsuccessful. But while waiting for the judge's decision, a man in the courtroom reportedly had a seizure and collapsed to the ground. Agnifilo immediately went to the man to attend the situation, according to the report. Per eyewitness reports, the unidentified man was convulsing and \"repeatedly slamming his head against the marble floor, blood and vomit pouring from his mouth.\" \"I canât imagine a busier five-minute period in my life,\" Marc Agnifilo reportedly told The New York Post. \"Iâm going down to see Combs. Everything was so intense, and my mind was on the case, and I walk out, and a man falls and is clearly seizing. It seemed pretty dire. I was worried about him.\" Read More: Diddy \"Freak-Off\" Escort Clayton Howard Continues To Launch Allegations Against Cassie \"Iâve just dealt with lots of seizures,\" he added. \"I just know exactly what to do because Iâve dealt with this before.\" Agnifilo's legal colleague Jacob Kaplan reportedly placed a backpack under the man's head to mitigate further harm, supporting his head for safety purposes. Then, Marc Agnifilo's daughter Sofia, a paralegal, an an unspecified member of Diddy's family unit reportedly checked the man's pulse and monitored his breathing. EMS eventually arrived, and respondents carried the man out in a stretcher. His condition remains unknown at press time, as authorities haven't disclosed any details or updates. Elsewhere, folks continue to debate about the Diddy verdict as more folks involved in the trial speak out. This includes jurors and alternate jurors who have spoken to the media in the case's aftermath. He remains behind bars, but a hearing on Tuesday, July 8 will determine whether the court speeds up his tentative sentencing date of October 3.

    "description": "Diddy is heading back into custody as Judge Arun Subramanian has decided to not let him get out on bond. Per Matthew Russell Lee for the Inner City Press, the two guilty counts are what keeping behind bars. \"I've read the parties submissions and others. The jury convicted the defendant of Counts 3 and 5. For the following reasons, bail is denied.\" Of course, those two are both of the transportation with intent to commit prostitution counts. Diddy did avoid the more serious counts of sex trafficking and racketeering, the latter of which would have given him life in prison. As it stands, the mogul could face up to 20 years. Each prostitution count equates to 10 years. But there's also a chance that he could get time served and could go home a lot sooner. However, that will be deliberated at another date. For now, Diddy is going to have to retreat to jail, presumably the Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC) in Brooklyn. The father of seven had been there since his mid-September arrest and it's been far from a clean and safe environment. He reportedly shook his head profusely when Judge Subramanian asked him if he wanted to return there.

He was simply ecstatic and quite sure that his dad was going to be a free man today. \"We love yâall, we love everybody watching. Iâm so happy my pops coming home, God bless and God bless the whole world,\" he told those watching ABC News. Moreover, one of his potential sisters added that she was \"happy and thankful\" for the results. Diddy did offer a bail package earlier today that included $1 million, surrendering his passport to Pretrial Services, complying with drug testing as ordered by Pretrial Services, various travel restrictions, and \"all other standard conditions of pretrial supervision.\" As for when Diddy's sentencing will be, Rap TV reports that October 3, 2025, is the day.

According to TMZ Sports, law enforcement in Miami Beach arrested him on Friday morning (July 11) for an alleged domestic violence incident involving his ex girlfriend, the mother of his children. Per reporter Andy Slater, the alleged altercation took place a couple of weeks ago on June 15 (Father's Day) a little after 9PM. Police reportedly searched for the boxer ever since, and a license plate reader tipped them off. Allegedly, he was picking up his children from his former partner's home, and things allegedly became confrontational.

She alleged that Tank struck the back of her head and caused a laceration by slapping her in the face. Furthermore, the alleged victim's mother told police she allegedly saw the aftermath of this alleged incident and saw her daughter \"visibly distressed and crying.\" Police also alleged that the ex girlfriend gave them a recording of the alleged argument, during which Gervonta Davis allegedly threw a small box at her.

We will see how this legal situation evolves in the near future, as this is still a developing story. In other recent headlines, Gervonta Davis has called out his losses. \"They took the fight from me and made it a draw becuz I did that bulls**t knee...\" he tweeted of his Lamont Roach Jr. fight. \"but I landed the most punches in the fight.. he didnât even hit me w a punch when I took the knee. I get it though, I shouldnât have done that but that hair grease was burning my eyes!\" Amid Gervonta Davis' other narratives, we will see how this alleged domestic violence case goes on.

He shared what seemed to be surveillance footage of the two of them getting out of a vehicle, and a man creeping through an alley to sneak up on them. The rapper then appeared to pull out a gun and fire multiple shots at the suspect as he ran away. \"I came home after Celebrating the success of a sold out Chef Fest with Love & support from all over the West Coast!

Now, TMZ reports that they've spoken with sources who have been in direct contact with Cole and Troy Ave, and they've confirmed that the whole thing was fake. Apparently, nobody really tried to rob Cole, and the rapper never fired any actual rounds. This lines up with San Diego police's story, as they say they didn't get any calls about a shooting or attempted robbery involving either of the two men. At the time of writing, they've not publicly addressed the ordeal. Read More: Taxstone Receives Yet Another Prison Sentence Over Troy Ave Shooting Case",

In a series of scathing tweets, she accused Punch of bullying her, and alleged that she has receipts to back up her claims. \"So glad I have proof of being bullied by AND being lied on by a man PUBLICLY, on a platform I use for my JOB; after I rejected his business proposition on more than one occasion,\" she alleged in part. \"He failed to disclose to the public that I had rejected his business propositionsâ and thereby acted in what appears to be retaliation purposefully used to cause financial damages & to engage in a smear campaign against the brand.\" Amid the tirade, SZA took to X to share a vague message about \"Mercury Retrograde\" and not taking \"bait.\" It appears that Nicki assumed the tweet had something to do with her.

    "description": "Joe Tacopina tore into prosecutors in Diddy's criminal trial on Wednesday after the jury found him not guilty of sex trafficking and racketeering. Discussing the outcome of the case on TMZ's weekly series on Tubi, United States V. Sean Combs: Inside the Diddy Trial, the celebrity attorney shut down the prosecution's argument for a racketeering charge. Tacopina previously represented A$AP Rocky in his assault case, earlier this year. In particular, Tacopina called back to the testimony of Capricorn Clark. While on the stand, she alleged that Diddy had her kidnapped and made to take a lie detector test for several days after some of his jewelry went missing. Addressing the claim, Tacopina noted that cross examination revealed she later tried to get her job back working for Diddy as his personal assistant. Read More: Joe Tacopina Reveals ASAP Rocky Recognized Rihanna's Smell In Court  Despite the jury finding Diddy not guilty of sex trafficking and racketeering, they did find him guilty of two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution. In turn, Judge Arun Subramanian set a bail hearing for him at 5:00 PM, ET. The defense offered $1 million bond plus travel restrictions, drug testing, and âall other standard conditions of pretrial supervision,\" according to CNN. Despite the offer, Subramanian ruled against letting Diddy out ahead of his sentencing. He referenced the Bad Boy mogul's prior attempting at getting bail and suggested nothing has changed in that regard. âAt trial, the defense conceded defendantâs violence in personal relationships saying âit happenedâ in relation to Cassie Venture and Jane,â Subramanian noted. He added that Diddy demonstrated a disregard for the law by continuing illegal behavior even after authorities searched his properties. âThis highlights a disregard for the rule of law and a propensity of violence,â he said. For now, Subramanian proposed a sentencing date of October 3, but admitted he'd consider moving it up at the request of the defense. The prosecution wants to conduct a pre-sentencing investigation before then. Prosecutor Maurene Comey said the court doesn't has enough information to properly sentence Diddy at this point.

    "title": "Shotta Kush Channels Real-Life Struggles into Raw, Melodic Trap on New EP",
    "description": "Independent artist Shotta Kush is preparing to release his upcoming EP Tales of a Lonesome Trapper Part One, a project that blends raw emotion with melodic trap pop. With a new distribution deal through Empire, the Charlotte-based artist is carving out his own space in the music world by telling deeply personal stories shaped by hardship, resilience, and mental health battles.\nThough he now calls Charlotte home, Shotta Kushs journey began in New Rochelle, New York, and took him through small-town Michigan and the streets of Miami Gardens before he found his footing in the Carolinas. Along the way, he faced more than just the typical struggles of an independent musician living with glaucoma and bipolar disorder has been a constant challenge, but one thats also helped him craft a unique and brutally honest sound.\nIve always felt like an outsider, he shares, but musics been the one thing thats never left me. That sentiment runs through his tracks, which are less about glamorizing street life and more about surviving it. His storytelling dives into themes of trust, perseverance, and building something real in a world that often feels fake. Shotta Kush strips the gloss off trap music, opting instead to show the pain, isolation, and slow grind behind the hustle.\nMusically, he draws influence from legends like Future, Drake, Lil Wayne, Money Man, and Anuel AA, but its his vulnerability that sets him apart. His lyrics reflect the mental weight of balancing ambition with inner demons, and his melodic trap style adds emotional weight to every bar. Having earned an associates degree in business administration, hes seen the struggle of trying to fit into a system not built for people like him, an experience thats deeply woven into his lyrics.\nTales of a Lonesome Trapper Part One, set to drop in July 2025, is a reflection of that reality. The EP leans into themes of independence, family loyalty, and making music with purpose, not just for flexing. With the support of Empire, Shotta Kush is stepping into a bigger spotlight while staying grounded in his roots and mission.\nListeners can explore his growing catalog on Spotify and stay connected through Instagram and TikTok. For exclusive content, music videos, and more, fans should check out his YouTube channel and follow along as Shotta Kush continues to turn lifes hardest moments into powerful music.\n 2025, Logan.

Formerly signed to a major label, he made the bold decision to take full control of his career by choosing complete artistic independence. Since then, he has carved out his own path outside the traditional circuits, with a sharp musical direction and a strong visual identity.\nRegistered with SACEM for the past two years, he handles all of his rights management, song registrations, and declarations himself, in a structured and strategic way. Balancing vibe-driven rap with introspective lyricism, MDI represents a new generation of artists who build everything themselves  without filters or compromise.\nA Style Rooted in Depth and Form\nMDIs musical identity is instantly recognizable.

Each track reflects a specific facet of his inner and outer world  emotional states, personal struggles, visions, and reflections.\nThe project is more than just a collection of songs. Its a journey  an immersive experience that invites the listener to explore a layered narrative. The entire project is accompanied by a cohesive visual universe, created by the artist himself using 3D animation and artificial intelligence. The videos connect to form a unified, narrative-driven whole.\nA Distinct Visual Identity\nThe central character  a visual alter ego of MDI  has become his graphic signature.\nDefined by a clean fade beard, opaque black sunglasses, a black hoodie worn over the head, and MDI written in bold white on the front and back, this figure reinforces MDIs artistic vision. His anonymity gives the character a universal aura: he could be anyone, in any neighborhood, city, or era. Its not about marketing  its about presence, energy, and intent.\nA 100% Independent Production Model\nWhat sets MDI apart is the level of professionalism he has achieved entirely on his own.

His tasks include:\n-Writing, recording, and mixing\n-3D animation, VFX, and cinematic editing\n-Organizing all 3D visual assets\n-Directing artistic scenes and choosing set designs\n-Coordinating special effects (green screen, lighting, etc.)\n-Managing physical distribution (CDs, booklets, QR codes)\n-Creating social media content, video editing, and release planning\n-Music Business & Production\n-Graphisme\n-Publishing\nThis radical independence is not a limitation  its a strength. With no censorship, no creative barriers, and no external pressure, MDI proves that its possible to aim high while staying self-reliant, structured, and visionary.\nA Collectors Physical Edition Prise de conscience Booklet on bandcamp\nAn exclusive USB booklet complements the project, designed as a fully artistic object that extends the experience beyond the music.

Whether he is producing for internationally acclaimed vocalists like Glisha, Annysia, Stephnia, or Spanish flamenco-jazz saxophonist Alicia Camia, Flo is an artist who thrives in the space where cultures collide and creativity runs wild.\nA graduate of Berklee College of Music, Flo moved from France to L.A. with a mission to connect communities through rhythm and sound. That leap into the unknown came with its own challenges of navigating a new industry, rebuilding a network from scratch, and confronting burnout from a relentless work ethic. But through it all, Flo stayed grounded by returning to what first drew him in: the power of music to move people.\nThe first time I ever played a show, I was 15, Flo recalls. After that performance, I called my brother and told him I finally understood why he became a professional musician. I felt transported by the connection with the crowd, like I could make a real difference through music.\nFlos career is as diverse as they come. As a leader of The FM Experiment, Flo explores live improvisation and genre fusion, creating complex, subtle, and evolutive grooves. Whereas with heavy rock bands like CLSTL, Flo strives strictly for energy. That same versatility applies when it comes to his production. Collaborating with Alicia Camia, they create a futuristic evolution of traditional folk music utilizing new instruments and textures. Whereas with Glisha, they focus on storytelling in creating a relatable musical world.\nWhat sets Flo apart is more than technical mastery; its his deep understanding of groove, improvisation, and sonic texture. Throughout his 15-year career, he has and will continue to focus his energy on helping others sound like the best version of themselves.\nIn a world saturated with trends, Flos artistry feels refreshing; it draws from a vast pool of influences and seeks to stand out not by its use of popular gimmicks but by an endless and fearless search for something new and unique. Ive learned to prioritize my mental health and find balance, he says. Thats what keeps the music honest.\nAs he continues building his brand and expanding his global reach, Flo Mavridorakis stands as a bridge between cultures, sounds, and people. His vision for the future? More collaboration, more genre-blending records, and more opportunities to make music that connects and exceeds expectations.

A sense of nostalgia floats through the mix, inviting listeners to get lost before the drums even fully settle in.\n2. Cali (feat. Streets) (Tranzformer)Classic West Coast influence shines here. Tranzformer blends boom bap drums with warm jazz samples, giving Streets the perfect canvas to paint Calis reality without romanticizing it.\n3. Trade It All (Big O)A reflective groove, almost spiritual. Big O offers lush keys and minimal drums, letting emotion take the wheel. One of those beats that makes you think about past choices while staring out a window.\n4. Inspiration (Tranzformer)Arguably one of the albums standout tracks. Tranzformer builds something cinematic, with layers of soul, horns, and drum breaks that move with intention. Its both motivational and meditative.\n5. Soul Good (Tranzformer)This track delivers warmth in every sense. Softly chopped samples hug gritty drums, creating a soundscape that feels like Sunday morning jazz on a Brooklyn stoop.\n6. Gravy (Tranzformer)Dusted textures and street soul. Tranzformer leans deeper into lo-fi territory, offering a moody instrumental thats both gritty and grounded. Its not flashyits honest.\n7. The Right Way (Big O)Big O serves up a dreamy, polished piece here. It plays like a love letter to soulful boom bap, with every loop chosen for emotional impact. One of the smoother entries on the project.\n8. W. Century BLVD (Big O)Named after the iconic LA boulevard, this instrumental captures the pace of city life. Its jazzy, layered, and cinematiclike walking through neighborhoods with headphones on full blast.\n9. Count On Me (Big O)Theres a warmth and reassurance in this beat. Big O brings in vocal chops and uplifting chords, reminding us that even in contrast, theres unity.\n10. Culmination (feat. L.O.U., P-Rawb, Decksterror)A posse cut that lives up to its title. Produced by both Tranzformer and Big O, its soulful and expansive. Decksterrors scratches add raw texture, while the verses bounce off the beat with perfect synergy.\n11. Fed Up (Remix) (feat. Fashawn, G-Rocka, Tranzformer)A gritty highlight. Fashawn and G-Rocka attack the track with precision. Tranzformers hook grounds the chaos while Big Os production keeps the pulse hard and real. Its boom bap at its fiercest.\n12. Run It Up (feat. Benny Canales)Pure adrenaline. Benny Canales (formerly known as 3D) delivers a slick verse over aggressive drums and haunting melodies. Its both a victory lap and a call to arms.\nDichotomy isnt just a beat tapeits a transatlantic conversation between two producers building a soundscape from shared vision but distinct perspectives. Its soul music reimagined for the boom bap generation.\nListen to the Full Album: Dichotomy on Spotify\n 2025, Variety Press. All rights reserved.",

    "title": "The Chanze2Star Music Festival: Where Tomorrows Stars Take the Stage Today",
    "description": "It starts with a beat. Not just the kind that rattles through speakers, but one that pulses in the heart of a dreamer. You can feel it in Richmond, Virginia, as the city prepares for one of the most anticipated grassroots music experiences of the year the Chanze2Star Music Festival.\nSet against the backdrop of Forest Hill Park, from July 25th through 27th, this three-day event is more than a festival its a movement. Built from the ground up by independent visionaries and powered by pure creative grit, Chanze2Star isnt just giving artists a stage. Its giving them a shot.\nIn an industry often locked behind velvet ropes, Chanze2Star kicks down the gate. Over 80 artists from across the country are converging in Richmond not to flex status, but to earn it. Genres collide: gritty hip-hop meets soul-stirring R&B, Southern country rap brushes up against gospel, pop, and alternative energy. Every performance is a statement. Every moment is a chance.\nWhat makes this festival different? Its in the name Chanze2Star. This isnt Coachella. Its not about whos headlining. Its about whos hungriest. Whos willing to step into the lights and prove they belong.\nFriday kicks things off with industry panels that feel less like TED Talks and more like real conversations raw, transparent, and rooted in experience. Panelists like Dom Hollins , Marty A. Johnson, Andre Williams (I Swim With Sharks), and Bob Carter will offer insights on branding, business, survival, and purpose in the music industry.\nArtists arent just performing. Theyre learning, networking, and getting the blueprint. Some will walk away with more than applause theyll leave with direction.\nEach day brings something distinct:\nThis is music in its purest form no industry politics, just passion, raw talent, and the relentless pursuit of connection.\nChanze2Star is also a celebration of local culture. From handmade jewelry and vintage fashion to vegan eats and Caribbean food trucks, the festival doubles as a market of Black and Brown entrepreneurship. Essence of a Woman Accessories, Vintage Wares by He Who Dares, Philly Vegan, and Noahs Rockin Buns are just a few of the vendors bringing flavor, fashion, and community spirit to the event.\nTherell be CPR demonstrations from Core Vitals, artistic spaces, live podcast tapings, and even chill corners for painting, yoga, and board games. Its a festival designed not just to entertainbut to build a whole ecosystem around creativity and healing.\nBecause youre tired of fake stages and hollow hype. Because you still believe in talent over followers. Because you want to be able to say I saw them before they blew up. Whether youre an artist, a music lover, or just someone who believes in the power of second chances, Chanze2Star is your kind of festival.\nIts a space where the underdog gets the mic, where the overlooked get a crowd, and where dreams feel a little more possible.\n Tickets are live.  Artists are ready.  The energy is unmatched.\nThis is your Chanze2Star. Dont miss it.\n 2025, Variety Press. All rights reserved.",

    "description": "Florida boy born and raised in Immokalee, Fl. When I started my music journey I really started from the bottom and by keeping my foot on the gas Ive been able to see some growth over the time. My motivation for my music thrives from my childhood always feeling like I had to work harder than everyone else around to set myself apart to stand out to be 1 of 1 at whatever I do or attach my name to.\nIf you really take a deep listen into my lyrics youll hear the pain youll hear the desire to make my mom proud, to better situations, to break cycles and most importantly my message to the streets on not accepting failure. to keep your head up in life no Matter what your facing cause life dont stop, and I can attest to that after I lost my first love which was basketball due to a medical condition,\nI picked up this mic and found my new passion my new therapy, and Ive been blessed to share it with everybody. Youll hear me quote theres only one way in and one way out  cause Its facts and I truly believe that if you give it all you got everyday and keep god first theres nothing in this life you cant have or conquer!\ninstagram: @daonly_1way\n 2025, Logan.

    "description": "Im pretty sure you know him. He enjoys camping in the middle of traffic with beautiful women, eating buffalo chicken sandwiches with Wendys French fries, and drinking an ice-cold drink. lol \nNow, the idea of the biggest content ever came to mind. KonradRows first experience was for media purposes, but this time, he was challenged with a line wrapped around the corner, with men and women lined up, just trying to experience the great event. It meant experiencing greatness among steamers and content creators.\nIt wasnt a Kai event, a Rolling Loud event, or anything like that. It was a Daniel Jean event dedicated to the NYC talent or any talent of the matter who wanted to network or showcase their product or talent. Im referring to models, rappers, street celebrities, trainers, hosts, and journalists like myself, even DJ Druski, D Chambers, Mr Commodore, Maino, and many other prominent names.\n@Dj Druski @Therealkonradrow\nThese individuals attended these events and paid their respects to the security personnel who ensured the events safety. They were well-respected despite the overwhelming crowd that kept coming. Additionally, @Naybrown was easy to reach, even when purchasing a flyer. The notable absentees were DJ Melody and Vina, but they are currently working on the Brooklyn Unity Fest, starring Kid and Play on August 2nd, so their hands are full.\nMy conclusion is that you dont want to miss the next event, which Daniel Jean has already hinted at as PT3. According to Tyler Perry himself, Daniel Jean is definitely the next one, so be prepared!\n 2025, Logan. All rights reserved.",
